"""Noctilucence"". Night occurs because a point on the surface is in the Earth's shadow. But, of course, it's just a shadow, it's not some magical global phenomenon. Above a particular point on Earth the shadow extends into space differently depending on the season, latitude, etc. For example, just below the arctic circle during summer near sunset or sunrise the shadow hugs pretty close to the Earth, and just a few km up might be in sunlight. Several hundred km up it's more likely to be in sunlight most seasons, but particularly during spring and summer at higher latitudes. The satellites are in direct sunlight so they are pretty bright, particularly against a dark night sky.

Because Starlink satellites are in low Earth orbit they are much brighter than others, even though they are pretty small. Every geostationary satellite is much bigger than a Starlink satellite and they are almost always in direct sunlight, but they are 90x farther away and so 8,000x dimmer.",0

There are ways to achieve ~10% the speed of light, which makes interstellar travel possible. See [Nuclear Pulse Propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion) (it involves dropping a small nuke out of the back of your spacecraft, accelerating, then dropping another, and another, etc).

For one, the amount of power needed to spin something that large that fast would end up being more expensive than the rocket. 

Secondly, rockets tend to be built to withstand massive forces, but not massive forces applied to a single side of the vehicle in a centrifuge. You'd have to essentially either fling a submarine into orbit or re-invent the rocket. 

Thirdly I'm fairly sure that if you throw something at exit-velocity whilst in-atmosphere you effectively expose it to full re-entry heating conditions instantaneously on the wrong end of the rocket. On top of that, the amount of drag created by the atmosphere would slow your vehicle down in seconds anyway unless you launched it at well above exit velocity. There's a reason rockets tend to stick to a lower speed before exiting the atmosphere to save burning fuel for no good reason.",0
I’m sure the engineers do. But the project managers? I doubt it,0

"**Space gun**

A space gun, sometimes called a Verne gun because of its appearance in From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, is a method of launching an object into space using a large gun- or cannonlike structure. Space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non-rocket spacelaunch. It has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into Earth's orbit (although after-launch propulsion of the satellite would be necessary to achieve a stable orbit), and could also launch spacecraft beyond Earth's gravitational pull and into other parts of the Solar System by exceeding Earth's escape velocity of about 11.20 km/s (40,320 km/h; 25,050 mph). However, these speeds are too far into the hypersonic range for most practical propulsion systems and also would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by aerodynamic drag.

Not to wanting to be thought of as slackers, SpaceX continued with this Triple Sized Boomy using liquid so cold it makes the Coors Lite Cold Activated Can shiver.

SpaceX plans to go EVEN BIGGER with an absolutely massive QUADRUPLE SIZED BOOMY later this year using liquid gas so powerful that it'd probably go well in your truck.

Each boomy gets bigger than the last one to test if they want to use a quad-sized boomy in the real flight.",0

"You can fling things into orbit.

Think of a continent-spanning chain. The torque would naturally elevate the chain and a long enough chain would peak above the atmosphere. Release a carriage at the right point and you'll be going into orbit or beyond.

But if you're spinning something on the ground then you're releasing the craft into the thickest part of the atmosphere. The drag will be immense, as will the aerodynamic pressure.

LEO translates to 17,500 mph. That's mach 23.

They need to end up at mach 23, after air resistance. Exactly how fast do they think they can fling a craft at sea level?

It would actually be much easier to change Earth's climate than to send a colony to a planet around another star.",0
"They plan to open the centrifuge momentarily to fire the launch vehicle out of it.  But, the centrifuge is housed within a gigantic vacuum chamber, the point of which is to reduce air turbulence and the instability caused by it.  So, when they open that vacuum chamber to the atmosphere, air is going to come screaming into the chamber, to fill the vacuum.  And, that air is going to be screaming into the opening out of which the vehicle is to be fired.  Wouldn't that introduce a shit load of drag and instability right at the moment of launch, which could send the thing totally off kilter?  Or, is the velocity just so fast right then that the vehicle clears that in-rushing air an its associated instability before there's a chance to cause any meaningful effects?

My other question.  They have to release the counterweight simultaneously with the release of the launch vehicle.  The launch vehicle is going to be going 4-5 thousand mph and will be hurled 200,000 feet up into the atmosphere.  So... what happens to the counterweight?  It's gonna be hurled at the same speed in the opposite direction.  That's quite the projectile they're gonna have to deal with, and they're gonna be dealing with it at close range and at maximum velocity.  It's gonna have to hit the ground to stop... how is that impact not gonna destroy everything near it, including the centrifuge assembly?",0

"&gt; So in other words, investors will invest since the company makes money + the promise of going to Mars

This assumes the company can make enough money to self-fund itself while remaining a private company so the investors can't steer the company into another direction.  
  
So far SpaceX only working with rockets. Building rockets capable of reaching Mars is hard, but not that hard (as the SpaceX almost there). Building rockets which are capable of reaching Mars, entering into orbit, LANDING, getting back into orbit, then coming back to Earth is a different, way, way, WAY harder thing. I really hope SpaceX can pull this off, but even if they can:  
They have zero experience in building long term habitats, which capable of keeping humans safely (and healthy!) alive. This feat alone likely harder than building the rocket itself which capable of transporting them.  
  
&gt; They’ll have the fundamentals and promising future plans to get investor money.  
  
Sadly, if this would be true, then SpaceX would already get enough money to pull this off. Right now investors seeing future in their LEO rockets, capable deploying satellites, and in the Starlink project. Both of these projects aimed a sector where the need was there for a long time, just the capability not. If someone capable self-funding engineers who can pull it off (like Musk did) then money will follow, because, while it is a risky investment, it is an investment capable bringing back your money, tenfold. Going to Mars would drain a huge amount of money (which for a private corporation means it gets destroyed, while for a state it pretty much comes back again as tax) and has zero MONETARY results. From the scientistic point of view, it would be a huge achievement, but sadly most of the investors don't care about it (or SpaceX would have enough funding...)  
  
&gt; Apple has $200+ billion cash at hand  
  
And last time when I checked they didn't plan to use any of it to make humanities life better (except some PR stuns), which sadly confirm the ""investors don't give a shit about humanity if it doesn't generate money for them"" line.  
  
I am personally all SpaceX (especially Starlink) fan, and what Musk and this company pulled off is simply amazing. And while Musk had multiple HUGE dreams which he worked hard (and found people who worked hard) to come true, not everything is possible. And Musk himself said that they only imagine themselves as someone who carries the equipment and people to Mars: the ""keeping them alive"" part is on someone else's job - here should an agency with decades of experiments in the space stations should come in, but the US congress like Boeing more...",0

"Not much wasted energy. It's just spinning in a vacuum chamber on low friction bearings, so actually very little of it will be wasted (remember, flywheels are an energy storage solution). Not anywhere near as much energy as you waste building an entire one-time-use rocket, assuming it works. 

Also, if you can get small amounts of cargo into orbit cheaply, that would be a game changer - opens up the doors to assembly of much larger craft in space. 

However, yeah, you're right. That speed does sound awfully slow. I wonder if that's a typo, or just the speed for the small prototype.",0
"It wont bring results unless there is a mission

Theres no framework for exostructure development right now, no short or long term goals, so no hype, and no extra funding. 

The sum of our country's (and imo the world's) efforts and resources should be focused on the long term goal of capturing and exploiting a platinum group asteroid from the belt. A sufficiently sized heavy metal laden asteroid can contain more rare Earth elements than the entire crust of the planet. All pre-purified and refined, all without destroying a single biome to get it. 

We should have our focus on establishing a lunar base to construct the next generation of space stations

We should have our focus on sending that space station on the Aldrin cycler to Mars 

We should then be using that now regular access to Mars orbit to establish an outpost 

We will use that outpost to stage mining operations in the belt 

And we will use that station on the Aldrin cycler to send payloads of more rare Earth metals than the planet could have ever provided us back to Earth and Luna.

"Once you are underneath from earth you have to use the energy you have stored. Any energy you can impart to the craft from the electrical grid is weight savings on the craft itself.

"It coasts to apogee, then lights a regular engine like a second stage to boost into orbit.

As for wasted energy, a lot of it is recaptured when braking back down to idle.  Then they can mount the next one and fire again an hour or so later.

That's really the target of the system:  to eliminate the cost bottleneck of a first stage, at least for small payloads.  Most of the cost of putting your payload on a rocket launch is the first stage.

While I am personally skeptical of the viability of it, one of their engineers is someone I know and hold in high esteem, and he seems to be confident in it, so I'll wait and see.",0

"Building an industrial base on the moon sounds tremendously more complicated and expensive than learning how to refuel rockets in low earth orbit.  That's the approach SpaceX is taking for their new rocket, they launch the vehicle with its 100+ tons of payload and the rocket that lands on Mars is itself a second stage to get to Low Earth Orbit.  5 or so tanker rockets then launch, dock, and pump their fuel over until it's full again and then it boosts to Mars.

Wouldn't it be nearly impossible to escape Earth's gravity with a craft that large without being half a mile long to accommodate fuel? We know the moon has raw resources to produce fuel and structural material, and possibly water- that would enable us to build and launch ships from the moon instead. You'd still need supplies from Earth, but you (hopefully) wouldn't have to haul tons and tons of fuel and steel.

"Don't worry! This plan doesn't actually remove lunar gateway, they just changed the name. It's now the ""Gateway to Mars"" though it's still in cis-lunar space.

"Using the Moon as a staging point for further solar explorations isn’t that useful, because of the Moon’s gravity well. It takes energy to leave and to enter it. The only way launching from the Moon would be more efficient than Earth, is if you could mine the metal on the Moon, construct the rocket there, and mine the fuel also. 

If you have to transport the material from Earth, all your low gravity gains are lost. Rocket construction is a massive endeavor that is difficult on Earth, let alone the Moon. Building a colony on the Moon that could build such rockets, would be more expensive than a Mars mission and would be a significant technological hurdle.",0

Once I start seeing headlines about cooperation between public and private entities about carrying the human biome into space and keeping it stable there, I'll start listening.

I agree that NASA is too bureaucratic, but I do not at all agree with your assessment of the employees. It all starts with the leadership, and in this case, NASA is directed explicitly by Congress. It is literally illegal for them to spend money in ways that are not approved by Congress and signed by the President. The stagnation you refer to is not the NASA researchers, who continue to make advances in astronomy, engineering, computation, meteorology, climatology and a whole multitude of other subjects, but it is instead that there is a political choke hold on every single one of their projects. 

I also agree that SpaceX is more likely to put a human on Mars (and maybe even the moon, who knows). And that is because their leadership is not beholden to the public, nor to Congress, and because they are a private company, nor to thousands of shareholders.",0

Then NASA started off its planning with [EMPIRE](http://www.astronautix.com/e/empireaeronutronic.html)

And [UMPIRE](http://www.astronautix.com/u/umpiredouglas.html)

And MORL, and FLEM, and JAG, and IMIS and MEM...

Then NASA '71, and [NASA '85](http://www.astronautix.com/n/nasa-lanlmarsmission1985.html)

Then a study every year or two until [that time Bush the Smarter totally took us to Mars](http://www.astronautix.com/s/stcaemcryogenicaerobrake.html).  Remember that time?  The real miracle is that Boeing actually produced the study they were paid for, though nobody saw it for decades.

NASA returned to annual studies for the rest of the '90s until they were killed by Bush the Dumber.  Then, in an election year, they spent an entire day grandiosely proposing a return to Mars, which was airily referred to for four more years.  No money was allocated and the ""plans"" were dusted-off pamphlets from the '90s.

The bill also specified a crewed Mars orbit mission in 2033.",0
That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works.,0
I doubt that we will get any fundamental and so risky investment without public funding. Bringing a human to Mars will be a task with costs billions and take more than 5 years.

"Honestly even i am more excited about mars than the moon i do have to agree that we can create and test so much on the moon, not to mention the fact that the moon is so close so in case something happens we can think about rescue of the astronauts. It would really make a lot of sense to first build thing on the moon and then go to Mars. Its also like you mentioned easier sending things to Mars from the Moon because of low moon gravity and thing produced in space or low gravity would have higher quality.",0

"**Mars Climate Orbiter**

The Mars Climate Orbiter (formerly the Mars Surveyor '98 Orbiter) was a 638-kilogram (1,407 lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, Martian atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars Surveyor '98 program for Mars Polar Lander. However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-force seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought it too close to the planet, and it was either destroyed in the atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars' atmosphere.

And as soon as they get the first Starship to Mars, you’ll see Congress buying seats as a logical extension of the successful ISS cargo &amp; crew programs.

Intelsat 708 was a telecommunications satellite built by the American company Space Systems/Loral for Intelsat.  It was destroyed on 15 February 1996 when the Long March 3B rocket failed while being launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China.  The rocket veered off course immediately after liftoff and struck a nearby village, killing at least six people.The accident investigation identified a failure in the guidance system of the Long March 3B.  After the Intelsat 708 accident, the Long March rockets greatly increased in reliability and did not experience another mission failure until 2011.  However, the participation of American companies in the Intelsat 708 and Apstar 2 investigations caused great political controversy in the United States.

"Radar response of such a far and small object would be pretty weak, making it very challenging or impossible to discern on top of noise. Remember, too, that radar signal strength falls as 1/r^4 . Per Wikipedia on ""radar astronomy"": ""Radar could detect something ~1 km across a large fraction of an AU away"". I believe the size of Viking-1 was no more than 10 m.

Speaking of wavelength and resolution, to be sure we need to determine object's orbit too. Let's estimate what accuracy we would need. Assume best-case scenario: Mars at closest approach(about 0.5 a.u., which is about 75 million km), Viking's orbital radius is 4000 km (Mars radius about 3400 km + generous orbital height of 600 km), needed accuracy is 10% of orbital radius. Plugging all these numbers makes required resolution about 5*10^-6 radian or 3*10^-4 degrees = 1 arcsecond. This resolution is pretty challenging for existing equipment, as e.g. Arecibo Telescope can resolve only 10^-4 radian.

Venus - Greater white (star) 太白 (the color white corresponds to metal in Chinese tradition)

Mars - Dazzling and confusing 熒惑 (since Mars was observed to have more variable brightness and travel across the sky more erratically than other planets, it was said to be malicious at certain times, causing illnesses, confusion, and insanity)

Jupiter - Yearly star 歲星 (Orbital period is about 12 years, which was a common grouping of years like the Western decade)

This is a test tank meant for the upper stage of SpaceX's new rocket, Starship/SuperHeavy (Previously BFR) which is meant to rapidly increase access to space and reach the Moon and Mars. Before anyone asks, it's most likely that they intended to test the tank until failure. 

[Elon tweeted that they were pressure testing the tank with cryogenic liquid nitrogen](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1222366667579117568) and went on to say that it reached 8.5 bar before blowing up. Overall sounds like a pretty good success.

The tank is a steel sphere about 30ft in diameter. It's a *production* prototype of Starship SN1's tanks. The middle part is integrated with the steel panels that will be visible on the outside of Starship and looked pretty shiney. They started building new big tents to do welding inside of and it seems they've had better success lately as a result. The steel rings they've been pumping out also look pretty incredible vs what we saw on the MK1 prototype. It's really looking like Starship is about to come together relatively quick.

Is Tyr identical to Zeus? No. But neither is Jupiter! Because of the *[interpretatio romana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca)*, we assume the Romans just wholesale adopted Greek mythology and replaced whatever it was they believed before that.

Yeah, but that's actually a great anology. German *is* more closely related to Italian than it is to, say, Mandarin (since both Italian and German are Indo-European languages).

"Right in Diodorus’ first writing it states they were “born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman”  with no nymph mentioned. Of course he is still labeling them as wholly male despite obviously feminine biological features. By modern definition they’re neither male or female, but rather intersex/nonbinary. Seeing as those concepts really didn’t exist at the time, he and other writers simply went for what was easier to explain than wrap their minds around concepts of sex and gender that wouldn’t fully exist for well over a thousand years later.",0
"Hi Everyone! 

Possible silly question: Given that space is a vacuum, does the mass of an object in space matter when it comes to propulsion? For example: two objects, one with a mass of 1KG and another with a mass of 1,000,000KG - would they accelerate at the same rate given the same propulsion? 

The only thing I can think of that would effect acceleration in a vacuum is the effect of gravity from surrounding objects, however if this was negligible, what happens?

"**Ariane 5**

Ariane 5 is a European heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family, an expendable launch system designed by the French government space agency Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES). It is used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). 

German and French government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane. Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales.

"**Interstellar probe**

An interstellar probe is a space probe that has left—or is expected to leave—the Solar System and enter interstellar space, which is typically defined as the region beyond the heliopause. It also refers to probes capable of reaching other star systems.

There are five interstellar probes, all launched by the American space agency NASA: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and New Horizons. As of 2019, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only probes to have actually reached interstellar space.

"1) Depends on what you mean by “interstellar travel”. We already have [five spacecraft on interstellar trajectories, two of which are now in interstellar space.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe?wprov=sfti1). Those are robotic spacecraft, and won’t reach another star for thousands of years. You probably mean crewed interstellar travel, preferably within a human lifetime. Assuming the longest trip you could convince someone to take was 10 years, you’d have to be going about 40-50% of the speed of light to make it to the nearest stars. That’s a lot of energy. I wouldn’t rule it out, but barring the discovery of a loophole that allows FTL travel, we’re unlikely to live to see it. 

2) Probably not. Earth in Interstellar was undergoing a global crop blight that was slowly wiping out plant life, meaning humans needed to relocate food production somewhere where an effective quarantine could be enforced. It’s a plot device to set up a plausible-seeming near-term reason to evacuate the planet that still gives people decades to prepare, but a universal plant plague like that is not likely.",0

Hell, maybe fur trees will evolve in 500,000 years to build spaceships, eh?  Maybe I need to be a dendrologist in order to completely rule this out!

You STILL wont answer why this has never happened before us, either.  Cuz it's obviously super inconvenient to your argument.

&gt;Also your adamant stance on life having to be like us to be like humans to produce science and advanced society seems close minded to me and lacking in imagination.

I didn't suggest it'd have to resemble us specifically.  That's your convenient misinterpretation of my comments to help your own argument.

But yes, I am talking about a species that would be as intelligent and technologically advanced as us.  This isn't close-minded, this would require an inherent lineage of supremely advanced mental and physical capabilities.

&gt;Maybe the norm from multicellular life to spaceflight is 500m years or 6 billion... Until we meet a bunch of different extraterrestrials and study their past we cannot know.

Maybe there is no 'norm' at all as the set of circumstances involved are so insanely rare that trying to ascribe some 'timer' to things is beyond absurd.

&gt;It took 300.000 years from the first humans til spaceflight but for the first 290.000 of them we were as advanced as beavers.

Complete bullshit.  You seem to have a *super* poor understanding of anthropology.  Proto-humans were already quite advanced in most cases, and the brain size growth existed fairly directly with our direct ancestry.  But even THAT wasn't enough, as other large brained proto-humans like neanderthals didn't make it, yet homo sapiens did.

And you, as usual, ignore the big points, like the one about beavers and apes existing at all already accounting for like 90% of the apparent miracle of advanced life to begin with.  You're ignoring all the crazy amounts of things that had to go so right in those billions of years to get to that point to begin with, and you're basically only arguing for that last 10%.

As for complex life taking as long as it has here to reach space is neither fast nor slow because we have no benchmark against which to compare.

"High-precision orbital determinations go back only about 100 years, and have gotten a lot better since then. A big improvement came from the Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990's. Before that, observations were just not accurate enough to detect the effects of solar wind and solar mass loss. To a large extent, they *still* aren't accurate enough.

So that leaves us with best-fit ephemerides using optical and a few radar observations; most of the good data comes from the mid-1960's and later. We can backwards compute these with standard gravity theories (i.e., General Relativity).

If there has been any change in the orbital distance Earth-Sun, it comes from the influence of Jupiter, Venus, and the other planets. It should be easy (!) to query the JPL HORIZONS system, to see if the average distance for 1920 is different from 2020, and if there has been any systematic change over the past 100 years.

... but it's time for me to fix dinner ... (back from dinner)

I checked with HORIZONS, and basically the orbit size changes by +/- 2 km on a roughly 12 to 16 year cycle. I had to do a lot of averaging to get that number, because the *instantaneous* (osculating) orbit changes by a lot more than that. There is a small trend upward, of less than 1 km per century, but it's just an artifact of the particular time period used. If I had picked the 16th century (for example), the trend might be in the other direction. It depends on the phasing of Jupiter, and takes a few thousand years for any systematic trend to show up.",0

No, this isn't the 'end of story'.  This is your 'feelings' on things, not some reasoned analysis based on real information.

And there's a WHOLE LOT more that had to go right for humans to come into existence and become what we have other than having water and energy and being in an 'average galaxy'.

It looks to me with their jargon that they’re fairly certain it was a planetesimal. We obviously can’t see the core of our own planet so it’s hard to compare, but most scientists infer that rocky, terrestrial planets have metallic cores and that it is not all too common for asteroids to be made up of entirely exposed iron/nickel.

So to answer you: They think it’s a planet core because our understanding is as rocky planets form, denser metals are pushed to the center of the planet, and seeing as 16 Psyche is virtually entirely dense metal, that’s why they believe it to be a planet without a crust. 

The question on hand for them is that it does have an odd characteristic: It’s much less dense than it should be. This could be solved if they can identify the presence of [ferrovolcanism](https://www.universetoday.com/143413/metallic-asteroids-might-have-had-volcanoes-erupting-molten-iron-thats-so-metal/#more-143413)  though and could confirm its status of a planetary core.

They copied the tradition of naming the days of the week after gods from the Romans, who did the same. In most cases they took the Roman god the day was named after, and substituted it with their own god who was most similar to the Roman one. Since this happened in Roman times, the naming of the days of the week actually predates the breakup of the Proto-Germanic language into Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse, Old High German, Old Low Saxon, and all the rest. Here is each day in Anglo Saxon and Old Norse. I put the name of the god in parentheses after each day.


* Monday: Moon's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Mōnandæg (Mone)

          Old Norse: Mánadagr (Máni)



* Tuesday: Tiw's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Tīwesdæg (Tiw)

          Old Norse: Tysdagr (Týr)


* Wednesday: Wodan's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Wōdnesdæg (Wōdan)

          Old Norse: Óðinsdagr (Odin/Óðinn)


* Thursday: Thunor's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Þunresdæg (Thunor)

          Old Norse: Þórsdagr (Thor/Þórr)


* Friday:Frige's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Frīgedæg (Frige)

          Old Norse: Frjádagr (Freyja)
(The day in Old Norse was named after Freyja instead of Frigg, the two goddesses may have been identical in the past)


* Saturday: Saturn's day 

          Anglo-Saxon: Sæternesdæg (Saturn)

          Old Norse: Laugardagr (Washing day)
(The Proto-Germanic language named Saturday after the Roman god Saturn, instead of one of their own. The Norse later changed it to be Washing Day)


* Sunday: Sun's day

          Anglo-Saxon: Sunnandæg (Sigel)

          Old Norse: Sunnudagr (Sól)",0

It's possible the confusion stems from the fact that both Zeus/Jupiter and Thor would use lightning, but that's where the similarities stop.

There's also the fact that the Nordic people adopted some of the week day names from the Romans, who had named them after planets, who in turn were named after Roman gods, so people may incorrectly assume there's a direct relation. However, Freya/Venus is the only god match-up that makes some sense. Tyr is assumed to match Mars because there are some old Latin texts that say so, but not enough information about Tyr has survived to know if that's true. Thor/Jupiter and Odin/Mercury are not a match. Some Germanic languages borrowed Saturn straight out, without matching to a Norse god, and some went with a completely different word.",0

&gt;Northrop Grumman currently enjoys what’s known as a “cost-plus” contract with NASA. That means the contractor will be reimbursed by the government for everything that is required to build this telescope — from the personnel needed to build and test the spacecraft to the facilities and hardware that need to be created to piece everything together. It also means if you run over budget, the government will pick up the expenses.

&gt;Northrop Grumman is in charge of building and testing  Webb’s sun shield and spacecraft elements. For a project as complex and  pioneering as Webb, errors are to be expected. But the errors made under  Northrop Grumman’s watch were avoidable, according to independent  reviews. Workers used the wrong solvent to clean the observatory’s  propulsion valves. A wiring error severely damaged the spacecraft’s  pressure transducers. During an important test, the fasteners designed  to hold the sun shield together came loose, scattering dozens of bolts  that took months to find

No, that's my entire point here.  We dont know enough to calculate these 'odds' whatsoever.  Most people just base it on some feeling or philosophical belief, not actual scientific deduction.

I really think people vastly underappreciate just how insane it is that we've evolved and progressed to where we have.  The amount of variables that had  to all line up perfectly right is crazy.

Let's say we build a probe and synchronize its clock with Earth, then we send that probe toward a star to observe it, one light-year away from earth, one light-year closer to the target star. Many years later on Earth we observe the star has gone nova and recall our probe. We check when the probe recorded the star exploding and we see that it recorded the nova 1 year earlier than we saw it on earth.

Light takes time to travel, just as sound takes time to travel.

Other relativistic effects and time dilation aren't germane in this observation of an event many light-years distant.

The light we see from Betelgeuse has been traveling for something like 642 years before it reaches us. That means if we see it going nova then that event happened 642 years ago at the location of the star and is only just now reaching our point of observation.",0

"**Optical spectrometer**

An optical spectrometer (spectrophotometer, spectrograph or spectroscope) is an instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials. The variable measured is most often the light's intensity but could also, for instance, be the polarization state. The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy, such as reciprocal centimeters or electron volts, which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength.

A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities.

He can't because the unlisted planets weren't visible to the ancient greeks and thus had no ancient greek names.

And notice if you go through this thread you'll see that every culture had their own names for the visible planets.

That's because no culture knew about Uranus, Neptune, and the rest.

Also notice that no one seems to have a name for ""Earth"" that is like the planetary names, the planet we stand on is nearly always simply called 'dirt/land/earth/tellus/terra' etc. Thats because no ancient culture understood that Earth was a planet in the same way that Mars and Jupiter (which were just moving bright lights in the night sky) were planets.",0

"Well, there are two answers.

First, as /u/KaneHau mentioned, the Earth's orbit is drifting outward at a rate of about 1.5 centimeters per year.

Second, however, is that the sun isn't a stationary object, even with respect to the solar system.  Just as the sun attracts all the planets, so too do the planets attract the sun, which means that the sun itself orbits a barycenter (a point which happens to be within the radius of the sun itself).  Furthermore, since the Earth's orbit is elliptical and not circular, this means that it is in fact quite rare for the earth to ever be exactly the same distance from the sun that it was during another point in time.",0

So as much confused they can be in English , partly because some of the translations to latin of Chronos used the version of Khronos which made the confusion even worse. In  Greek both those names are never used for similar meanings. They neither sound the same or written the same way.

Also I am Greek so I am aware how Chronos is written in Greek.",0

"&gt;light doesn't actually slow down when passing through matter (like water). It takes a different path, bouncing between molecules or something

Going to paste my reply from another comment.  


 

&gt;You can imagine the electrons interacting with the electric component of light, these interactions will induce their own waves which interfere with each other and the original wave to form a wave front which is (usually) trailing the original wave front.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is more accurate because photons being absorbed would not affect the direction of the photon that is then emitted, i.e if you shone a laser into a block of glass (or any material) you wouldn't get a beam out the other end, you would just get the light being scattered causing the whole block to light up.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other issue is that in some materials, the phase or group velocities of light actually exceed C, this definitely can not be explained by photons being absorbed and then reemitted as it would need to take negative time.

What happens in the sun is as you describe, but it isn't the same as in transparent materials. The sun is opaque to light which is how it gets absorbed and reemitted in a random walk, causing extreme scatting. The reason it takes so long is because the direction is completely random, so it takes a very long time for energy associated with a photon to randomly reach the edge of the opaque region.",0

Greek mythology is great and all but there are tons of sources and we tend to take a couple of cosmogeny versions as canon.

In other cosmogenies Oceanos was the first being.
Doesn't say much.

Other times Kronos was the same deity as Kronos God of time, other times no. 

Other times Tartaros was a deity portrayed by a place, and other times it was just a place.

And the list goes on and on up until at least the Olympian Era where mythology is pretty much the same.

Zeus also was portrayed as the Father because he was the one ruling the land. As did Poseidon rule the sea and Hades the underworld. 

So they were portrayed as gods by the ancient Greeks and worshipped as such with each god having different role in each aspect of society. 

Also there were some Titans that were worshipped as gods.",0

"Far from it, Uranus was the ruler of the sky and Gaia the ruler of the Earth. There was no royal hierarchy not even in Olympians. Zeus was a leader not a king.

On the very top we have many diffirent candidates. We have Chaos as a mentions, Nyx the night itself , Chronos time itself , not to be confused with Kronos the leader of titans. In other stories we have elements, like fire , water and air. In another scenario which also very popular we have the element of Logos, which in ancient and modern greek translates to speech, writting and logic. So general Ancient greeks believed not in characters as the top but rather concepts and fundamental ideas.

While Gods are characters themselves. For example Zeus is often refered by hollywood and modern foreign writers as the sky god, which of course is not the case, Zeus was just a god, lighting was just a weapon that Cyclops or Hephaestus made for him. On the other hand Uranus was the actual sky. So it actually a lot more complicated than you think.

&amp;#x200B;

So the diffirence between Chaos and Zeus or any other gods was massive, also on the practical side too, Chaos had no temples and no worshipers , or Uranus or Gaia. Gods did. Hesiods does not present them as characters but rather philosophical notions. But then he never goes in depth either, he rather focus mostly on Uranus and Gaia because they play a fundamental role to his storytelling.

"What hyperbole. Even full-blown Kessler syndrome doesn't result in an ""impenetrable shell"", you can pass through such orbital zones with little risk of collision and what risk there is can be mitigated with a bit of armor. It's a significant risk only for things that want to stay orbiting *within* such zones for long periods of time.

The density of orbital debris is higher in lower orbits, but the lifespan of orbital debris is much lower in lower orbits. Small fragments experience more atmospheric drag and perturbations due to solar pressure, so they deorbit sooner. So low Earth orbit would only be hazardous for a few years or decades after a full-blown Kessler cascade, and that's the altitude where Kessler syndrome is most likely to occur in the first place.

Debris can be cleaned. There are various approaches under development, and I'm sure that development would speed up if important orbital regions actually became hazardous.

And finally, our planet isn't ""dying"". And even if it were, there are no other planets to ""escape"" to that would be remotely as hospitable as even the worst-case scenario post-apocalyptic Earth. If you're worried about Earth dying your best bet is to build survival bunkers here rather than trying to build them someplace orders of magnitude more barren.",0

Install some terrestrial produced engines, electronics and life support and you've got a massive ship in orbit at a fraction of the price launching it out of Earth's gravity well would cost.

"If we can go to the Moon, we can also go to ""nearby"" asteroids.  In fact two of those asteroids, Ryugu and Bennu had sample probes sent to them recently.  The Japanese probe is already heading back to Earth, and the US probe is planned to head back next year.

If you look at [this plot](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/plot/Inner2.gif) of the inner solar system, the circles are the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.  The red dots are ""Near Earth Asteroids"", defined as coming less than 1.3 times the Earth's distance from the Sun.  There are over 21,000 found so far, and some of them are ""metallic"".

The metallics are typically 90% iron, 9% nickel, and 1% cobalt.  Other asteroids have carbon compounds.  If you add some carbon to an iron alloy, you get a steel alloy.

Steel wouldn't be the most efficient material for a habitat.  A fiber-reinforced lighter metal like aluminum or titanium would weigh less.  But steel is used for all kinds of other industrial things.

Eventually 98-99% of space projects could be made from materials already in space.  That avoids most of the launch cost from Earth.  The other 1-2% are rare materials not easily found in space, and hard-to-make items like computer chips and plant seeds, where its just easier to send them from Earth.",0

"Ancient Greek Religion (which wasn’t an actual organized dogmatic religion but rather a continuum of cults) persevered until after 850AD but at that point it was marginalized.

They possibly number up to 100.000 cult participants but this whole discussion is a can of worms in Greece for many reasons (Orthodox Church is still very influential, far right groups participate in both orthodox and ancient rite organizations etc).",0

"Fun Fact:  Ouranos (Uranus) is not a god. In ancient Greece gods are inferior divine beings and as a matter of fact, there were multiple level of gods, with different degrees of power.  

Ouranos and Gaia (she is not a god either) gave birth to titans (not gods either but vastly superior in terms of power and abilities). The top of the food chain is Chaos himslef or should we say itself according to Hesiods the father of ancient Greek mythology and religion, second to none including Homer himself. 

Other divine entities far superior in power compared to gods are the well known Cyclops and the Ecatocheires. Both practical unbeatable, the first in knowledge (the essence of science, knowledge and technology) and latter in physical power (their name translates in Greek as the ones with the one hundrerd hands)

Even monsters were superior in power to gods, the example being Typhon, the ""god killer"" a beast Gaia unleasted when Titans were defeated. Although that its inacurate Gods will never have won the war if they have not enlisted the help of not only Titans but also the heavyweight of Cyclops and Ecatocheires. The latter kept Titans in the jail, the well known ""Tartarus"". Typhon made gods flee in terror, its was the manefistation of Gaias wrath, Zeus tried to fight but left paralyzed when the creature not only defeated but removed his nervous system. Fortunately for Zeus , Ermis (Mercury) located the nerves , managed to restore Zeus and Zeus after a very long fight, managed to trap the monster temporarily under the mountain Atna , a volcano in Italy which if I am not mistaken is still the most active a sign the Typhon sleeps waiting to be awaken once more by its mother Gaia, the Earth itself.

No. There's not enough mass in all the asteroids combined to change the Earth's mass in any significant way. Sure it would add some mass but it's insignificant compared to mass of Earth.

And in fact, Earth is already gaining mass every day as it always has. Tons of interplanetary stuff from dust to crumbs and bigger particles and objects hit the Earth atmosphere every day. That mass flux is estimated roughly 30-180 tons per day ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063316302434)) which would mean 11,000 - 66,000 tons per year.

Saturn - 土星 (Earth/Land Star)

Uranus - 天王星 (Star of the King of Heaven)

Neptune - 海王星 (Star of the King of Sea)

Bonus track: Pluto - 冥王星 (Star of the King of the Underworld)

It's interesting to see how the five closest planets were named after the traditional elements of wuxing, whereas the most remote ones mirror the Greek/Roman etymology used in English and other western languages. This does make sense, as Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were discovered much later in history.

Also notice how the word 星 (""star"") is also used to refer to other sorts of heavenly bodies.",0

 *  Jupiter - tzedek (justice)
 *  Saturn - shabtay (named after the Sabbath, as that's the day it was typically associated with)

Uranus and Neptune have official Hebrew names (Uranus - oron, meaning small light; Neptune - rahav, an ancient name for the sea), although most just call them Uranus and Neptun. Pluto is just Pluto.",0

"""100 to 200 million years down the road, we get so good at asteroid mining...""

Well... you might not be too familiar with the way technological growth curves work (I'm guessing you've never read any books by Ray Kurzweil, for example?) but really it's more like just a few decades from now that we'll have the expertise to do such a thing if we really wanted to! 

So ya, no need to wait for 100 to 200 million years of technological evolution to pull off such a basic simple task such as adding mass to a planet. (With 100 to 200 million years of additional technological years of evolution, we'll hopefully be long gone, moving on to far more profound things like perhaps even creating new universes! )

------------------------

But ya... anyways, the answer to this question is that it is simply not something you need to worry about. 

Even if we bring home HUGE and massive amounts of precious metals from asteroids, it will not make any significant difference to Earth's overall gravitational distribution. 

So of all the things that could go wrong in the future, for you to worry about... this you can be certain is at the absolute bottom of the list.

But hey: if this concern is still keeping you up at night worrying, then just know this: 

With 100 to 200 million years of technological evolution, at that point you'll simply be able to snap your fingers like magic in that far future, and have a massive fleet of robotic anti-gravity machines instantly obey your command, and lighten the load that planet Earth is carrying, by flinging unneeded material off Earth!",0

When an element gets big enough it's very unstable, and breaks down into smaller elements almost instantly.  Elements like Oganesson can only exist for fractions of a second, and don't exist anywhere in nature except maybe very briefly in supernova and in the particle accelerators used to make them.

Can't remember where I read it, but apparently light doesn't actually slow down when passing through matter (like water). It takes a different path, bouncing between molecules or something.

"I will address your post in no particular order.

&gt; we have somehow observed the universe expanding and came to the conclusion that it must have at one point been MUCH smaller.

This is kinda obvious if you think about it, but the big bang happened everywhere at the same time. To give the universe a size is problematic because it leads you to believe that at the beginning there was an explosion that sent stuff in all directions, an explosion into 'empty space'. In fact, when we say universe, it IS space, it IS time. So at a certain instant in time (we don't know whether this is the first instant, or if there is a cycle, or if time has always existed and the big bang was some random perturbation in the quantum foam), space started expanding everywhere. Thus, the big bang happened everywhere.

Talking about density is closer to the truth. Near the beginning, everything was dense and hot because most particles were squeezed up against each other side-by-side. Since more available space is being constantly produced by cosmological expansion and because for complex physics reasons matter does not like being in this compressed state, matter starts diffusing and the universe begins to cool down. At this point it would be the end of the story if not for the weak and frankly forgettable force called gravity. Billions of years later, instead of a eternal, uniform and lifeless fog of dimming hydrogen (well, mostly), we have all kinds of cool macro structures like galaxies and stars.

The universe would be a vastly different place without gravity, is what I'm saying.

&gt; I also know that scientific consensus seems to indicate that the entire universe was once the size of an atom

The consensus is that the universe was once super-hot and super-dense. For most people, it suffices to say the universe was once super tiny, but as explained above, if a person carefully thinks about it, it really is a nonsensical idea to try to assign size to the entire universe*. The key thing to remember is that careless handling of facts will lead you astray.

* Assigning size to our *observable* universe is much easier and well-defined. It is about 93 billion light years across.

&gt; Moreover how did they decide it was ever a singularity at all? Why do we not assume it is expanding and collapsing over and over infinitely in both directions taking billions or even trillions of years between beats?

The Big Bang theory is an explanation of how our current universe came to be, it is not trying to explain how it began. Here is a perfectly compatible origin theory: God waved his hand, and there was a Big Bang. Replace God with cycles, branes, multiverses, etc.

&gt; I also know people talk about cosmic microwave background radiation, but I have no idea what that is. They keep showing the crazy looking heat map with mostly blue and green blotches with some yellow and red specs randomly thrown about. I don't really understand what this map shows or how it proves the big bang.

The CMBR is the earliest possible snapshot of the distribution of matter and energy in the universe. Before that time the universe was too dense and hot for light to travel very far. So all you would see (if you could) would be a glowing, uniform fog when in fact the universe was already becoming a very interesting place. As soon as the universe cooled down enough that light could travel in straight lines for a long distance, you can begin to see these structures. The CMBR is very strong evidence of the big bang because we can measure its temperature and compare it with cosmological redshift (a prediction of the big bang). It matches near perfectly.

So the sequence of events we think happened:
??? (the beginning?) &gt; BANG &gt; expansion ---&gt; after a long time, cools enough that light can travel ----------&gt; we see this ancient light, and work backwards. The distance this light has traveled and it's temperature coincides exactly as if the BANG and expansion happened.

Finally:

&gt; From everything I understand about the way things work, all events have to be triggered by something.

This probably isn't true. For example, what causes the decay of U-235 into Th-231 ? Beats me. At ground level, the universe may be many, many events happening completely at random. Only at the macro scale do we start to see 'laws' arising ie. a deterministic universe.",0
"Every element has a atomic number determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. We have found all from 1 to 118 and many of the especially high number ones is very radioactive and exist only for a fraction of a second. These elements can't be found in nature since they decay into other more stable element and are created in particle accelerators. Uranium with 92 protons is the heaviest stable naturally occurring element.
Elements with even more protons than 118 in the nucleus can exist, but we need particle accelerators with higher energy for this. 

The next possible stable atom could be with 126 protons and I think maybe 164 protons, but we don't know for sure and it will not exist naturally.",0

"**Faster-than-light communication**

Superluminal communication is a hypothetical process in which information is sent at faster-than-light (FTL) speeds. The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment.

Superluminal communication is impossible because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to transmit information into the past. This contradicts causality and leads to logical paradoxes.A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including tachyons, quantum nonlocality, and wormholes.

If you take the total actual cost of HST servicing into account then you get a total cost figure of around $10 billion, equivalent to the current cost of JWST (even with all its overruns). Now, it was never an option, but if you were to ask astronomers whether it makes sense to plow $10 billion into continually sprucing up a 30+ year old space telescope versus, say, splitting that money up into separate allocations for individual instruments, you're gonna get most of them opting for the second option. Going forward, we do have the option to make such choices, and we should generally always (at least in the near term) a series of iteratively more advanced telescopes than one constantly refurbished one. Imagine, for example, trying to refurbish the Opportunity or Spirit rovers instead of launching the much more capable Mars 2020 rover.

Sure, to an outside observer you can get arbitrarily close to the speed of a laser: 99%, even 99.9999999%, but to you that laser will always be 100.00% the speed of light relative to you. In order for that to work it means that a lot of funky and non-intuitive stuff has to happen with space and time, but as we've found with over a century of extensive and meticulous experimentation, that stuff absolutely does happen.

So they built their own version, the Buran, and flew it about a bit, and quickly confirmed their suspicion that the Shuttle was really built to deliver and service spy satellites. When the Cold War ended, congressional support for the Shuttle fell off sharply, and the programme ended in 2011, with no backup plan for delivery of personnel to orbit, since that was never its main purpose.

More recently, Boeing has been testing an unmanned long-duration spaceplane for the military. And no doubt there are similar programmes going on, at various stages. None of this is even slightly new.

"What do you mean by the opposite of stars? In a trivial sense stars release light and energy while black holes trap light and energy (and mass of course) so yes they are opposites. But beyond that not really.

There is an opposite of black holes called a white hole, that have been theorized (read the math works but we haven’t found one and aren’t even sure if they can exist or if the math just allows for them). They are frankly so weird I can’t even really conceptually internalize them. But as I understand it, they are regions of space with mass, spin and an event horizon. But the area inside the even horizon cannot be reached by anything outside the white hole. 

Basically they are like a super exclusive night club that no one can enter, but people keep leaving. The paparazzi stand outside (the event horizon) getting pictures of everyone as they come out, but no one ever gets past the bouncer at the door... They may be the tombstones of evaporating black holes, they may be created by some other weird phenomena, or they may just not really exist no matter what the math says is possible, or the math we have may be wrong and we need to figure out where the problem is.",0

"" NASA's Curiosity rover took this selfie on Oct. 11, 2019, the 2,553rd  Martian day, or sol, of its mission. The rover drilled twice in this  location, nicknamed ""Glen Etive"" (pronounced ""glen EH-tiv""). **""**",0

"Regarding the holes, do you think it's possible that a multi-million dollar rover that was sent to another planet may have drilled more than one set of holes at some point in time?

In fact, according to a link that is included under the picture, those are the 20th and 21st holes drilled by the rover.  So the images are clearly different.

"There was a TV show on Syfy channel called Dark Matter, they used that method for long distance travel.

They could download their consciousness and memories into a clone body far away while their real body went into stasis.  They could use the clone to do whatever they liked and when they returned to the pod the clone's new memories would transfer back to the original body with the consciousness.  If the clone body died the original body would regain consciousness but not any of the memories of the clone.

I think that would be the tricky part, not just memory transfer but consciousness transfer, having hundreds of bodies isn't useful if they only share old memories while creating new unique memories of their own.  This type of technology would settle the debate on whether consciousness is an emergent property of large scale memory storage and indexing or if it exists independently from the memories it can access.",0
"[This page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Solar_system) has the answers to a lot of questions about the abundances of various things, along with [this paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20060901133923/http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf) for a more in depth technical explanation.  

The simple answer seems to be that it's just not actually all that special.  Although nickel is relatively common, it's still 4 or 5 times less abundant than iron, which itself is much less common than oxygen, carbon, and silicon (and way way behind hydrogen and helium).  It's with iron so often just because they're both heavy metals that tend to sink to the cores of forming planets.

The more technical answer is that it's the next stable element up after iron in stellar/supernova nucleosynthesis.  [This chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#/media/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg) illustrates where the various elements have mostly come from in the universe so far.  One thing you'll notice is that things don't change drastically at iron.  Although iron is the last element that can be created while releasing energy in normal fusion, there are other processes that can continue to add to the atom past that.  The [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process) and s-process are two ways that free neutrons in a star will transmute iron up into heavier elements.  The r-process (for rapid) happens in violent events like supernovas and neutron star mergers, while the s-process (for slow) happens gradually as smaller stars like our own age.  Thanks to things like this a noteworthy amount of iron ends up being turned into all the higher elements in the periodic table before or during a star's death.",0

"&gt;Could it be possible that substantial amounts of the debris found within our asteroid belt actually come from 16 Psyche's planetary form?

From what I've read it's very unlikely.  Asteroids can be divided into ""families"" of similar composition (meaning they probably shared an origin), but 16-Psyche doesn't fit into any known asteroid families.  So if it was a planet the rest of it is no longer int he asteroid belt.",0

"The problem is the total mass of the asteroid belt isn't even close to enough, if you combined everything in the asteroid belt it'd be far smaller than our moon, and even a full order of magnitude less massive than Pluto.  The compositions of the asteroids also just doesn't work with that, they vary too much to have possibly come from a single body.

The asteroid belt is the ""leftovers"" from the formation of the solar system, that couldn't form into a single large body because of Jupiter pulling the individual rocks around.

If 16-Psyche is the remnant of a larger body the rest of that body is no longer in the asteroid belt, because its composition doesn't match the rest of the asteroids in the belt.  What likely happened (if that is how it formed) is the rest of it merged with whatever impacted it to form a new planet or planetoid, which was then ejected from the solar system.  In the planet forming era of the solar system things were pretty chaotic, a lot of bodies were formed then ejected from the solar system by gravitational slingshots.

I'm curious to hear how you think the rover gets cleaned off, since that is what would be necessary to be completely pristine still after being on the surface of Mars for 7 years.

"Adding to the other replies, I found this:


All the material that eventually formed our solar system is essentially recycled star dust. All iron on Earth (and in 16 Psyche) was produced by large stars that existed before our Sun formed: the iron was created during nuclear fusion and later released when the parent star(s) exploded, presumably supernova. 

After our solar nebula had formed and material had been gravitationally compacted, dense elements like iron did not get far from the center of the nebula before ""precipitating"" out into planets and meteors. Thus the inner solar system has a high abundance of iron. This is in contrast to low-density elements/molecules that were in general able to escape the center of the nebula and make it pretty far before being pulled into a large mass. 

So we have high iron planets and meteors close to the sun (relatively speaking), and very little iron in the ""gas giants"" part of the solar system.",0

"**Shape of the universe**

The shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy.

Cosmologists distinguish between the observable universe and the global universe.

"[Shape of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)

""Flat"" refers to the entire space-time existence of universe: past, present and future. Bundled, or depicted in a way that is comprehensible to draw. Space and time are intimately related through general relativity.

 If the universe starts off from a  big bang, gets really big, then starts to collapse, and ends in a big crunch, that is considered to be a ""Closed"" shape, in that, you can see the beginning, middle and end of the entire universe depicted as one finite object. 

An ""Open"" shape is one that starts to accelerate, and become geometrically larger over time.   
A ""flat"" shape is a balanced point between the two above whereby the expansion of the universe continues to slow, and reaches zero expansion at infinite time.",0

"It's not a cube either, but for a moment let's imagine a 2 dimensional universe in the shape of an infinite flat 2D sheet of paper. If you walk in any direction on this flat universe you could continue going on toward infinity.  

Now imagine another 2D universe in the shape of an infinitely long cylinder. You could say this universe is flat along one axis but *curved in 3 dimensions* on the other axis. You could walk infinitely along the length of the cylinder but if you followed a path perpendicular to that you would inevitably end up back where you started because the curve wraps back around.  

It's harder to visualize this in 3 dimensions because the curve is in an even higher dimension but it works exactly the same, in a flat 3D universe you could keep going in any direction but if the universe curved in a higher dimension it could eventually wrap back around somewhere.",0
"Another meaning is that it’s the same in every direction. There are galaxy clusters, but on the largest scales visible matter is spread pretty evenly throughout.",0

"Well let’s think about what goes bad most often on a refrigerator. I don’t repair them, but I’d assume it’s the capacitor in the compressor or the compressor itself. Both of *those* things could be made of a higher quality and extend the life of the fridge, without increasing the price too much. Of course, if anyone reading this is a fridge repair man, insert the actual parts you have to replace most often. 
     For example, if rigid used a higher quality bearing on the armature for any of their wet saws, I wouldn’t have nearly as many motor failures. I can’t replace just the bearing. The entire armature (half the motor) needs to be replaced. That makes it easier for me, but more expensive for the customer. In the case of a warranty repair, more expensive for rigid, but I’m sure they factored that in and ultimately make a higher profit from the machines to cover the ones that do fail during the warranty period.",0

According to: https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/where-is-the-rover/",0
"I figured, but I couldn’t scroll too long at work looking for it. So thank you!",0
"
&gt;From what I do know about the big bang, the reason we even know about it is because we have somehow observed the universe expanding and came to the conclusion that it must have at one point been MUCH smaller. I also know people talk about cosmic microwave background radiation, but I have no idea what that is. They keep showing the crazy looking heat map with mostly blue and green blotches with some yellow and red specs randomly thrown about. I don't really understand what this map shows or how it proves the big bang. 

When the big bang theory came along there was another theory called the steady state theory. Steady-state theory is a view that the universe is always expanding but maintaining a constant average density, with matter being continuously created to form new stars and galaxies at the same rate that old ones become unobservable as a consequence of their increasing distance and velocity of recession.

The cosmic background radiation is often called the smoking gun, because it is the evidence that the big bang theory needed which let it prevail over steady state. It is the residual effects of the big bang. The redshift of distant galaxy is another proof, but it wasn't enough to discount steady state.



&gt;Moreover how did they decide it was ever a singularity at all? Why do we not assume it is expanding and collapsing over and over infinitely in both directions taking billions or even trillions of years between beats? 

We actually do not have proof of the initial singularity yet, but because we have the cosmic background radiation and etc we do know that the big bang happened even if we do not know for certain about the singularity. We do know that if you reverse the expansion enough that spacetime would becomes infinitely dense.

As for expanding/collapsing that is a theory for the end of the universe it is called the big bounce. The reason why it is not the prevailing theory is because we are now observing that the universe is expanding exponentially because of dark energy. We don't know what dark energy is but as long as the universe continues to expand like this the leading deaths for the universe are the big freeze/heat death/big rip. We will never know if the expansion universe eventually slows and reverses but right now we are not observing that.


&gt;Also, they seemed to have settled on the big bang having started about 14 billion years ago, but why are they assuming that there ever was a beginning to it. Why are they not assuming it has always been getting larger at an exponential rate? Then going back in time, the universe would just be getting smaller and smaller and time would be slowing down more and more always getting closer to zero, but never reaching it. Why are we not assuming the universe is infinite with no beginning? 

Since the universe was so dense time and space didn't exist the way we know it. So we cannot assume that there was a before the universe because before can't exist before time exists. 

However we do believe the universe is infinite because if you were able to get to the edge of the observable universe and looked past what we can observe on earth we assume that all you would see is more universe! You could keep going to the edges of the observable universe and continue to see more universe. Since time and space is one thing and space is infinitely large then time is also infinite. 

&gt;From everything I understand about the way things work, all events have to be triggered by something. If the universe isn't infinite and it did get started, then what was the triggering event that started it? How would it even cause the trigger to fire if there was no universe for the triggering event to happen and no amount of time for it to even happen in? People always say, ""humans are incapable of wrapping their minds around infinity."" For me, infinity is really easy to understand, finite time and finite space is the one that I have trouble with; especially something happening outside of the finite time and space. 

There doesn't need to be a reason that the expansion started. If it never happened it wouldn't have mattered because there wouldn't be anything around for it to matter to. It is only because it happen that it matters. It seems significant to us because it is significant to us, but if it didn't happen no one would be around for it to matter. I don't believe there needs to be a trigger for the beginning of the universe to be significant, it's significant because now the universe exists. Sorry if that's more philosophical, but the question seemed more philosophical.",0

"The cosmic microwave background is the first light in the universe that was able to travel a long distance. This required the universe to cool enough and the density to drop enough for atoms to form. Charged particles can absorb pretty much any frequency of light, whereas neutral atoms can only absorb specific frequencies.

This was originally emitted when the average temperature of the universe was around 3000 K and the light has been redshifted to a temperature around 3 K from the expansion. The images you're used to seeing show the temperature variations of the CMB, where blue a colder than average and red is hotter. Note that the deviations from the average are very, very small. 

The small deviations are evidence that the early universe was homogeneous. That they're incredibly small points to the universe expanding very rapidly in the beginning (look up cosmic inflation).

We have good observational evidence for the age of the universe.

If you consider your hypothetical friend who lives on the other side of the earth, you can converse in real time over the phone, even though one of you sees daylight and the other is staying up way too late. The difference in local time doesn't affect communication at all.

One fun thing about Mars, though, is that it has a slightly longer day (24.5 hours per day, roughly). So while one day Curiosity's sunrise might be similar to a spanish sunrise time, after 90 earth days, the rover would have seen only 88 sunrises, and it would now be something like 4 hours out of sync. We often call Mars' days ""sols"" to help keep the difference in mind.

The biggest problem that I've heard of with sols is that if you have people working in shifts based on the rover's time (which isn't crazy: a night has different concerns than a day), then the part of the day your shifts start moves around in the day slowly.",0

"This is quite a complex topic which makes up the first section of most astronomy courses, but essentially there is something called the cosmic distance ladder.  


The distances to close stars can be worked out by parallax which uses geometry to work out the distance to objects. If you hold your thumb out in front of you and close one eye, then swap to the other, you'll see your thumb move relative to the wall/background. This apparent movement depends on the distance between your eyes and from your eyes to your thumb.  


We can do the same by measuring stars relative to distant background stars/objects and by using the distance between one side of the earth's orbit and the other as the distance between our eyes. If the angle between these two measurements is equal to one arcsecond (1/3600th of a degree) then the distance to the star is 1 parsec (Like parralax-arcsecond) which is about 3.3 light years.  


This works out to a few thousand light years which covers most nebulae we see. Past this point we use other methods like comparing the apparent brightness of variable stars with their absolute brightness's.",0

Boeing starts lobbying like hell because they know the only thing that can affect spaceX are laws.,0
"Just to let you know, you don’t have to threaten them with voting against them. you could also call your representative and say that you oppose this specific legislation. Your elected officials actually do care about your voice, ESPECIALLY on issues that aren’t super partisan where their hand is forced by their ideological base. Space issues are very much susceptible to public opinion. If you call your congressperson or senator and say “please keep competition in our space program and oppose [x] bill,” that call will have an impact- for most reps, it will have more of an impact than even the lobbyists. 

After all, the only reason reps accept money from lobbyists is to spend money on advertisements to get your support. I know it’s easy to be cynical, but the truth is there are banks of staffers waiting by the phones to hear what the voters have to say. They collate that information and pass it along to the representatives. It DOES matter, and carries more weight than any other individual factor when reps are considering how to approach a bill.

"&gt;Really it shifts away from the moon being seen as a way to get to Mars and more of the goal in and of itself.

Why is this at all a political decision?  Whether or not the moon is a good way to get to Mars is an engineering question that a couple of politicians have no business answering.  I think there is a great case to be made for building and launching interplanetary missions from a shallower gravity well like the Moon, but even if I'm wrong about that, I trust scientists and engineers to tell me over some corrupt politician who's sending work to whoever donated most to his campaign.  


&gt;Still disappointing to me and definitely could be motivated by kickbacks from Boeing, but SpaceX is not working on the equipment to make ""flags and footprint"" visits to the moon so they are not an option.

Executive orders are also far more limited than you are implying here.  They are just as the term implies: orders by the President for people in the executive branch of the government to act in a certain way.  Related to military orders, it is something where the President can compel other federal officers to act according to some policy where the law is absent or something within the President's range of discretion.

"What is 'militarization' when it comes to space?  

Rockets were used by the Germans to terrorize the UK, particularly London.  Operation Paperclip snaffled up about 1600 German scientists, including Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team.  Those scientists went on to work for NASA and were beyond critical to getting the US's space program going.  Their crowning achievement was the Moon landing.  Without militarization, rocketry might have fizzled (hah) out after Goddard, and we might have no satellites at all in orbit.  

The Space Race was driven by politico-military competition between the US and the Soviet Union.  Without the threat of a peer adversary, do you think NASA would have gotten the funding it did?  Without militarization we would never have landed on the Moon.  

GPS was originally a military technology,  Its antecedents go back to the Navy's TRANSIT system.  The single only reason that billions of dollars in funding were originally provided for GPS development and launch was to enable SLBM targeting.  Without militarization, you'd be using paper maps and a compass.  

Many technologies originally developed for military purpose have dual use functionality.  Even more so than that, now that the global economy - and particularly the US one - is reliant on space to function, space has become a vital part of our national infrastructure, one that must be protected at all costs.  The costs of losing access to space are literally incalculable.  

Just as the ocean was once the sine qua non of international commerce, so too in the 21st century is space.  The US - unlike, say, China - has no desire to literally take over control of all of the near-Earth space, but it must absolutely be able to protect its national interests and those of its allies.  That means that the US must not only be able to DEFEND on orbit, it must be able to present a credible threat to the assets of its adversaries in order to deter them from precipitous action.",0

"Your question isn't obscene, as much as it is ignorant.

Having a space force is not the militarization of space. Space is its own domain. Just the same as Air, Sea, Land, etc. Whether people want to recognize it or not, space has played a major role in the national defense of nations since the start of the space race. Many nations have assets in space that allow them to better navigate, collect imagery, produce different EMS effects, etc. 
GPS is not a civilian application. it has civilian applications, but it was not designed with civilian use in mind.

The US is designing a Space Force to better manage and protect the assets in space that are used for national defense. The very same way that other nations do. Creating a Space force allows for a special appropriation of monies from congress to better manage, protect, and develop space assets.

Thinking that a Space force militarizes space is ignorant. placing weapons in space does that. Demonstrating that you can destroy spacecraft from terrestrial systems, does that.",0

"There is a huge contingent of physicists that would agree with you. The major difference is that almost everything we know about the universe tells us we are right. We have an immense amount of data that indicated the standard model is correct, there are just a few niggling issues out there we just can’t explain. 

The last time physics hit this wall was in the late 1800’s when the Newtonian model of physics was perfected. There were just two questions that we didn’t have an answer for. 1) what happens at very high speeds (relativity), and 2) what happens at very small scales (quantum mechanics). Almost everything that has been done in physics since then has been in service to just those two questions. 

We now are starting to get a pretty good grasp on those, but they have led to a couple other issues we can’t explain at all.

 A unified theory of everything (combining relativity and quantum mechanics) simply doesn’t exist. The models they need to work are conflicting. 

Why is time Uno-directional. All physics equations work equally well in reverse if you time flows backwards. But we can’t explain why we only perceive time to flow in one direction. 

Where did all the anti-matter go? Making matter from nothing is doable, but it always pops into existence with an exactly equal amount of anti-matter. But the universe only contains matter, so where is all the antimatter?

Why is gravity so weak? We think of gravity as being powerful but it is trillions, or trillions of trillions times less powerful than the other forces. Why is this?

I tend towards thinking the standard model is wrong in the same way the Newton is wrong. Almost perfectly correct, but also completely wrong.",0

"Apollo was also very expensive due private contractors being involved, no different than today. I will concede the deadline as being \*one\* of the reasons the costs were so high but by conceding the deadline it also goes to prove the point I was making. I reject the claim that costs would be reduced because we did it already once. I highly doubt it, if anything they will be higher. Those efforts won't magically reduce the costs to engineer, from scratch, landers, capsules and so on. They have to be designed, built and tested and they will be brand new designs. If they were simply recreating Apollo 1:1 sure, that previous work would have been useful. They aren't. Much that original work doesn't even exist anymore anyhow.

Let's look at one component. The capsule. Orion was announced May 24, 2011. Over 8.5 years ago. This work was based off of CEV which was announced January 2004. That means Nasa has spent 16 years working on a capsule which still isn't done. It looks like no real work has even started on the lander. Last time the lander took roughly eight years to complete.

"Our best model of particle physics is bursting at the seams as it struggles to contain all the weirdness in the universe. Now, it seems more likely than ever that it might pop, thanks to a series of strange events in Antarctica. .

The death of this reigning physics paradigm, the Standard Model, has been predicted for decades. There are hints of its problems in the physics we already have. Strange results from laboratory experiments suggest flickers of ghostly new species of neutrinos beyond the three described in the Standard Model. And the universe seems full of dark matter that no particle in the Standard Model can explain. 

But recent tantalizing evidence might one day tie those vague strands of data together: Three times since 2016, ultra-high-energy particles have blasted up through the ice of Antarctica, setting off detectors in the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, a machine dangling from a NASA balloon far above the frozen surface.

As Live Science reported in 2018, those events — along with several additional particles detected later at the buried Antarctic neutrino observatory IceCube — don't match the expected behavior of any Standard Model particles. The particles look like ultra high-energy neutrinos. But ultra high-energy neutrinos shouldn't be able to pass through the Earth. That suggests that some other kind of particle — one that's never been seen before — is flinging itself into the cold southern sky. 

Now, in a new paper, a team of physicists working on IceCube have cast heavy doubt on one of the last remaining Standard Model explanations for these particles: cosmic accelerators, giant neutrino guns hiding in space that would periodically fire intense neutrino bullets at Earth. A collection of hyperactive neutrino guns somewhere in our northern sky could have blasted enough neutrinos into Earth that we'd detect particles shooting out of the southern tip of our planet. But the IceCube researchers didn't find any evidence of that collection out there, which suggests new physics must be needed to explain the mysterious particles.

To understand why, it's important to know why these mystery particles are so unsettling for the Standard Model.

Neutrinos are the faintest particles we know about; they're difficult to detect and nearly massless. They pass through our planet all the time — mostly coming from the sun and rarely, if ever, colliding with the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up our bodies and the dirt beneath our feet.

But ultra-high-energy neutrinos from deep space are different from their low-energy cousins. Much rarer than low-energy neutrinos, they have wider ""cross sections,"" meaning they're more likely to collide with other particles as they pass through them. The odds of an ultra-high-energy neutrino making it all the way through Earth intact are so low that you'd never expect to detect it happening. That's why the ANITA detections were so surprising: It was as if the instrument had won the lottery twice, and then IceCube had won it a couple more times as soon as it started buying tickets.

And physicists know how many lottery tickets they had to work with. Many ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos come from the interactions of cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. Every once in a while, those cosmic rays interact with the CMB in just the right way to fire high-energy particles at Earth. This is called the ""flux,"" and it's the same all over the sky. Both ANITA and IceCube have already measured what the cosmic neutrino flux looks like to each of their sensors, and it just doesn't produce enough high-energy neutrinos that you'd expect to detect a neutrino flying out of Earth at either detector even once.

""If the events detected by ANITA belong to this diffuse neutrino component, ANITA should have measured many other events at other elevation angles,"" said Anastasia Barbano, a University of Geneva physicist who works on IceCube.

But in theory, there could have been  ultra-high-energy neutrino sources beyond the sky-wide flux, Barbano told Live Science: those neutrino guns, or cosmic accelerators. 

""If it is not a matter of neutrinos produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with the CMB, then the observed events can be either neutrinos produced by individual cosmic accelerators in a given time interval"" or some unknown Earthly source, Barbano said.

Blazars, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, starburst galaxies, galaxy mergers, and magnetized and fast-spinning neutron stars are all good candidates for those sorts of accelerators, she said. And we know that cosmic neutrino accelerators do exist in space;  in 2018, IceCube tracked a high-energy neutrino back to a blazar, an intense jet of particles coming from an active black hole at the center of a distant galaxy.

Click here for more Space.com videos...
ANITA picks up only the most extreme high-energy neutrinos, Barbano said, and if the upward-flying particles were cosmic-accelerator-boosted neutrinos from the Standard Model — most likely tau neutrinos — then the beam should have come with a shower of lower-energy particles that would have tripped IceCube's lower-energy detectors.

""We looked for events in seven years of IceCube data,"" Barbano said — events that matched the angle and length of the ANITA detections, which you'd expect to find if there were a significant battery of cosmic neutrino guns out there firing at Earth to produce these up-going particles. But none turned up.

Their results don't completely eliminate the possibility of an accelerator source out there. But they do ""severely constrain"" the range of possibilities, eliminating all of the most plausible scenarios involving cosmic accelerators and many less-plausible ones.

""The message we want to convey to the public is that a Standard Model astrophysical explanation does not work no matter how you slice it,"" Barbano said.

Researchers don't know what's next. Neither ANITA nor IceCube is an ideal detector for the needed follow-up searches, Barbano said, leaving the researchers with very little data on which to base their assumptions about these mysterious particles. It's a bit like trying to figure out the picture on a giant jigsaw puzzle from just a handful of pieces.

Right now, many possibilities seem to fit the limited data, including a fourth species of ""sterile"" neutrino outside the Standard Model and a range of theorized types of dark matter. Any of these explanations would be revolutionary.hjh But none is strongly favored yet.

""We have to wait for the next generation of neutrino detectors,"" Barbano said.

The school I started at in 2000 had ~100 computers and ~500 pupils, they were along all the hallways and library and just popup computer corners everywhere they could fit them.

"There's actually a lot of research done for NASA by private companies and a lot of times it is meaningful. I used to work for a small company that did a lot of SBIR programs for NASA. NASA sends out requests for proposals for a variety of different areas of research they are interested in. Companies write proposals and submit them and NASA determines who to award the contract to. The programs start at 6 months and go to 2 years if you reach the second phase and after that is commercialization. NASA puts a fairly big emphasis on commercialization and it's often obnoxious because you have to write parts of your proposal to somehow sell this very specific research as something that can be commercialized for terrestrial use. It's a hard thing to do when you're proposing a device designed to use solar energy to supply heat to a reactor that is extracting oxygen from lunar regolith for lunar bases.

The hard reality is, pure space exploration is rarely a profitable endeavor and if you're going to have private companies entering the fray, you're going to need to give them a profit motive. I think there's an inherent need and value for NASA to do a lot of the space exploration for the sake of exploration and the science for the sake of science thing, but there's also a need to give private companies a carrot on a stick in the form of monetary reward to drive some stuff forward and forward faster. It has to be a balance between the two. The problem with situations like this is that this is Boeing essentially cheating the system because they have the lobbyists to funnel all the contracts and money to themselves and Boeing doesn't have the best history of being cost conscience with on time delivery, but they don't need to be because they have the political power to get what they want.",0
"I've had a theory for a while. It goes like this.

Disclaimer: This is coming from a wikipedia-level understanding of the topic and should be taken about as seriously as a creepypasta.

TL:DR; Idiot on the internet says the inside of a black hole and outside of a white hole are the same thing and that's what the universe is.

We live in a 4 dimensional universe: 3 spatial dimensions, 1 time dimension.

The time dimension isn't actually particularly unique. Except, movement (at the speed of light) in that dimension is compulsory. Life as we know it has simply evolved in this environment, and so we happen to experience this compulsory movement in the time direction as, well, time.

The event horizon of a black hole is essentially the threshold when the compulsory-movement dimension is no longer the one we're used to (""time""), but one of our 3 dimensions becomes the compulsory-movement dimension. In other words, toward the ""center"" of the black hole, upon crossing the event horizon, IS the compulsory direction while inside the black hole. It's not physically possible, or causally possible, to exit the event horizon.

Thing is, you can't actually reach the center, either. Because on the other side of the event horizon, the travel from the edge of the event horizon to the center/singularity is TIME. What we call ""time"" actually becomes a spatial dimension inside the black hole.

If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that objects falling into a black hole fall in at the same location but at different times. On the inside of the event horizon, this means that the objects have fallen in at different locations but at the same time.

Furthermore, the closer you are to a black hole, the more of your world line (possible actions) takes you to the center. In other words, the closer you are, the less possible directions you could travel to get away. In other words, just outside the edge of the event horizon, the only possible escape is directly away from the event horizon at nearly the speed of light.

In other and stranger words, this means the spatial size of the event horizon gets larger and larger from your reference point. This also means that as you cross the event horizon, the spatial size of our universe gets smaller and smaller relative to your reference point.

Okay, okay. So, a visualization. There's a black hole, and you can see the event horizon. So you approach it. The event horizon starts to look bigger and bigger. Not just because you're closer. Like, it's actually growing in size. Eventually, it gets so bizarrely large that the outer edge seems to expand *behind* you. You look back, and the edges just seem to continue overtaking your home universe. And your universe starts to look like a white circle, a white event horizon of sorts. So what was once the ""center"" of the black hole is now *every outward direction away from your home universe*. Your home universe becomes a sphere, with an apparent center, that you can no longer go back and reach again. Entering that white sphere would be equivalent to escaping the black hole's event horizon.

At least that's what you would see in a naive simulation.

But remember the flip of compulsory-movement dimension? And remember that on the outside of the black hole, everything enters at the same location but at different times? But from inside the black hole, everything appears at the same time, suddently, but in different locations, expanding out infinitely from a point?

You can't actually ""look back"" at the white sphere I mentioned earlier, either. To do that you would have to look backwards in time. Can't be done. A more complete simulation would show you entering a black hole, and at the moment of crossing the event horizon, a sudden intense ""flash"" of energy of everything that has ever fallen into the black hole appearing all at once and expanding in every direction.

Yeah. That starts to sound like a while hole. And it starts to sound an awful lot like the big bang. And it starts to sound like our universe is a white hole.

Why can't something escape a black hole? Because that's the equivalent of us attempting to travel to the big bang. That can only be done by traveling backwards in time, which can only be done by traveling faster than the speed of light.

So, yeah. If we could travel back in time to the big bang, somehow survive the intense energy and somehow survive the primordial absence of physical laws that keep matter held together, somehow continue traveling back in time before that initial moment... Then we would have escaped a black hole's event horizon, and emerge from that black hole and into our parent universe.",0

"&gt; And when people say that time didn't exist before the big bang, does that just mean that space didn't exist (infinite density) and therefore time couldn't exist either?

This by the way is just one hypothesis of the Big Bang, others are even weirder. But it’s the one Stephen Hawking accepted so I assume it to be true until we have a better idea. 

The thing is that physics can’t really look back this far. We live in a universe with constants, things like the speed of light, the gravitational constant, electromagnetic constants, etc... there are a number of them. But there is evidence that these constants were not necessary, and may have been in flux at the moment of the Big Bang, and only solidified into their current state after it occurred. Basically the universe could have looked very different than it does, and so far as we know there is no physical necessity that required these constants to look the way they do. Because all of modern physics is dependent on these constants, when they break down so does all of physics, eliminating our ability to look any further back.",0

I forget the exact mechanism but basically quantum and thermal fluctuations can happen on such a way to destabilize the local vacuum energy in such a way that it ""breaks open"" one of the underlying fields of the universe, like the Highs field or one like it. This actually is theorized to have happened fractions of a second after the big bang when the inflaton field (that brought the universe from smaller than a pinhead to thousands of light years in diameter in a millionth of a millionth of a second) ""broke open"" and showered the universe in low entropy elementary particles like quarks and electrons.

The most expensive part is the camera since you can’t really cheap out on that. The telescope doesn’t have to be that expensive to get good photographs like this though. The important part is having a good mount. Preferably a tracking one since you need to adjust the telescope every shot to make sure it’s still in frame.

You then have to put all the photos together in some software to get the detail you want.

If you have a tracking stand then you can just take a really long exposure photograph with the telescope tracking. Since planets are so bright it’s not actually that hard to take pictures of them",0

"The short version: the expansion follows the Hubble law. So the further the distance between two objects, the faster they are moving away from each other due to the expansion. The value of that proportionality, called H\_0, is around 70 km/sMpc. So A distance of 1 Mpc will expand 70 km in one second. So it gives you a rate at which distances expand. But now you can just reverse that and calculate the time at which everything was close to each other. Simplified that is given by 1/H\_0, which equals roughly 13.8 billion years. So thats how the age of the Universe is estimated in a simply form. The actual calculation is a little bit more tricky, but are in principle the same. 

Also in regards to your example about rewinding until everything is hot and dense. Thats what is done and our understanding of things break down at around 10^(-36) s after the BB. Whats happening before that is completely uncertain. Especially in the Planck era, below 10^(-43) s , anyhing is possible and we do not know for sure how long it lasted. Could be 10^(-43) s or could be as long as infinity.",0

"Some rain would be nice.   Oh that’s right, we need a atmosphere.",0
To inanimate objects? Yes. Do you even understand the concept of empathy?,0
"Once you get to around Jupiter/Saturn's volume then you reach an interesting weird inflection point. Past that point as you add mass and increase core pressure and temperature in objects you transition out of gaseous/solid states and into plasma states, and the increased pressure translates to increased density. More mass depends the gravity well, which increases central pressure, which results in higher densities.

Note that the only thing that breaks out of this cycle of increasing density is increasing thermal heat from fusion, which increases internal pressures and puffs up stars. Without that you actually get objects that get smaller with increasing mass as you go from jovian planet to brown dwarf to white dwarf (quiescent stellar core) to neutron star to black hole.",0
so being empathetic or showing empathy is a mental illness? wow,0

"Another question, is it possible that the singularity existed forever? Was it just always there and then started expanding. Before it started expanding time wouldn't have existed. So in a way was it there for ""eternity,"" but not the typical way we define eternity?",0
"Your thought experiment is actually what lead to the development of the Big Bang theory. Once we realized the universe was expanding (although not necessarily at an accelerated rate) a natural question that arose is what happens when you rewind time all the back as far as we can. The result is that the universe becomes infinitely dense and infinitely hot. The theory had some strong disbelievers at first (“Big Bang” was originally used as an insult to describe how silly the theory sounded) but has since gained massive support.

There are alternative theories, such as the Cyclical Universe theory which states that after expanding forever we reach another “bang” and create another universe. It’s also possible we exist inside a black hole and the Big Bang was its formation. However, these theories have very little traction and are very far away from being provable. So far the Big Bang is our best explanation.",0

NASA has been held back because it's used as a political football and it's jobs for the boys. That's why NASA has facilities in every state. That's why programs are constantly launched then cancelled and you end up with a completely disjointed vision and huge white elephants like the Shuttle or the SLS.

Luckily the new space race will allow independent players (Musk, Bezos) to start to dictate the game and they won't be subjected to this political back and forth anymore.

yeah I always thought the rovers were the same size until I saw that photo or similar. I guess i just always thought they were the same size due to the cost to send weight to mars. BUT it did launch in a window when mars would be much closer than it had been in a long time so they saved a lot if delta V so the fuel savings is probably why they were able to send such a large rover and planned ahead.

Pulsars are (were) great because of their extremely accurately defined (and reliable) rotations. The idea was this data would be unique enough to not only identify a common object in the sky but also act as a sort of laser pointer directly to earth.

The more consistently rotating laser pointers you track, you can work on narrowing down the single point in space they all collectively point at at one time or another in their rotation.

Sadly Voyager 1 was launched only 10 years after the first pulsar was identified as a pulsar. We just didn't have enough information to realize they weren't as reliable as we predicted.

Since Voyager was launched we've discovered many new pulsars and, more importantly, lost sight of others. Not only this but individual pulsars aren't as reliable as we thought. Their rotational period being changed by things much more complicated than I understand.",0

"**The Last Question**

""The Last Question"" is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov.  It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and was anthologized in the collections Nine Tomorrows (1959), The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), Robot Dreams (1986), The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986), the retrospective Opus 100 (1969), and in Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1 (1990).  It was Asimov's favorite short story of his own authorship, and is one of a loosely connected series of stories concerning a fictional computer called Multivac.

"A realistic(ish)* rotating skyhook would be ~700km long, with an orbital speed of ~7.5km/s. We want the hook end to move at half orbital velocity at this point, so we can supply half the speed via rocket and the other half via skyhook. With a circumference of 2200km, that's a rotation period of ~10 minutes. When attaching to the hook you'd be moving at the same speed it does, so unless you're doing anything wrong, there's no immediate jerk, and the rest is just a centrifugal force calculation. The formula for centrigual acceleration is `a = v^2 / r`, and we know `v=3.75km/s` and `r=350km` from above. This ends up at ~40m/s^2, or about 4G.

4G is outside where you'd expect a regular airliner to break, and it's going to be an uncomfortable experience for any passengers. (normal take off is ~1.1G, so only 0.1g above normal). We can assume passengers would be optimally oriented so as to take G-forces, and it appears humans can take 6G for at least ten minutes when the force is perpendicular to the spine, without loss of cognitive facilities or lasting damage.

If we are to reduce the G-force we would have to increase the length of the skyhook. For this, we're going to need some new materials.

"3 - until recently the ionic engines used by NASA had very low powers.

For example NSTAR, 3 engines pushed the DAWN probe, it has a power of 2.6 kW and used for 24 hours it consumes 300 g of Xenon.

The new PPE that will push the Gateway has a total of 49 kW engines and consumes 8 kg of Xenon per day.

The X3 engine (XR-100 for AR) ran at 102 kW but can reach 200 kW (at 800 V) or 250 kW (at 1000 V). In the world there is no vacuum chamber that allows you to test it at maximum power

1 X3 at 1000v = 100 NSTAR

*****

I come to your objection

First of all, without an engine like the X3, you don't have the possibility of reaching powers for which nuclear power exceeds solar power.

In my opinion, the problem is not in NASA trying to continue a line of development, but in the American presidents who change objectives at each change (I am a European observer, but trump is at the third objective in 3 years. First the moon with the gateway complete, then the expedited landing and then now landing in 2028 with preparation for Mars).

In other words, how do you do something if the goal changes faster than your ability to accomplish? You always create the same modules (like legos) that you assemble in a different way. I wouldn't complain about NASA trying to keep a line, but who is constantly changing that line

After all, the PPE is useful for many different missions, in fact, it can carry large loads (for example it can move in EML2 with a mass of about 100 t, consuming much less than 1 t of fuel)",0

"I think there are a few misconceptions here that should be unpacked. 

First is the effects of relativity on the speed of light. Since you’re referencing “it’s” time dilation, I’m assuming you’re referring to the distant object. Unfortunately, the relativistic motion of the remote object wouldn’t effect how long it takes for the time to reach us. The speed of light is constant in any given reference frame. That means that once the light is emitted from the object (likely at a very high blue or redshift) it would still take the light the same amount of time to reach us. The speed of light is always the same, and thus the rate at which information can reach us from a distance is always capped by that speed.

Secondly, the fact that the remote object is relativistic does not change the fact that we are not. For example, just because we observe a supernova in another galaxy (which has ejecta at significant fractions of the speed of light) doesn’t  mean that the properties of our local space time will change.

So unfortunately no, this idea won’t work, but it’s an interesting thought!",0

"&gt; I still don't get it. If light is traveling at a constant rate, and the universe has been in existence for 13.8 billion years, the photons would have to be massively accelerated to reach us from anything greater than 13.8 billion light years away.

No, they have not been accelerated they just had to cover a longer distance to reach our region. They are here much later than expected. That's because the universe expanded all the time while the light was traveling towards us at lightspeed. So the light had to cover much longer distance to finally reach us. 

And at the same time the expansion little by little stretched the light to longer and longer wavelengths and it experienced *redshift* (not to be confused with Doppler shift which is different physical process).

In cosmology there's different measures of distance for different things. In following example I'll use this nifty standard model cosmology calculator: http://astro.ucla.edu/%7Ewright/ACC.html

Note that results depend on which cosmology you use and parameters in your model. For example open and flat universes give you different results as does different values for density parameter Ω and Hubble's constant H0. I'll just leave them in their default values for standard cosmology.

**Let's say we observe a very distant galaxy with redshift of z=7. What is the distance to it?**

The galaxy emitted that light about 13 billion years ago when the universe was only about 0.77 billion years old. Then the universe was much denser than today and has been expanding since. So those days the galaxy was much closer to us. How close?

**Angular distance is 3.6 billion light years**  

This is how the distant object looks like to us in size. To put it simply: see a galaxy close to you and it looks big, see a galaxy far away and it looks small. That gives you angular distance.

This is how the galaxy looked like 13 billion years ago when the light was emitted towards our region in space. So we now see the galaxy as it was 13 billion years ago.

Yet it doesn't look like a galaxy 13 billion light years away form us. It looks big as a galaxy much closer to us. In size it looks like a galaxy that should be just 3.6 billion light years away. What's up with that?

It looks bigger because when the light was emitted 13 billion years ago the galaxy was much closer to our region in space. We see it now as it was then. And then it was much closer only 3.6 bn light years away.

But if it was only 3.6 bn light years away then why it took 13 bn years for the light to reach us?

Because universe has been expanding. All that time light has been traveling towards us the space in between has been expanding. So for the light the journey got much longer. Eventually the light had to travel 13 bn light years to finally reach us. And that took 13 bn years. 

And over the years and distance the expansion of universe also affected the light. Little by little it got stretched with space, and bit by bit its wavelength became longer, which means redder. The light got *redshifted* (note, that is very different process from Doppler shift which is about speed).

**Comoving distance is 28.8 billion light years**  

This is the current distance to the galaxy with the expansion of the universe in the standard model. This is how far away it currently is. We of course cannot now see it as it currently is. That would take 28.8 bn years plus all the delay caused by expansion of the universe.",0
I thought it died? Or was it the one that got stuck in a dude where no light could get to the panels... is there a working rover on mars anymore?,0
"Quoting Wikipedia: “Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging cosmological constant), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a ""future visibility limit"" beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.)”

"I get what you are saying, but there's a few reasons that does not work. The biggest is that time dilation occurs when you are traveling at relativistic speeds. It still takes the same amount of time to get there. 

And that's why its ""seeing into the past"". Because it took so many years to get here, you are seeing what happened when the light left.",0

I have 2 answers for you,

1 when NASA had the kilopower available, it immediately proposed an NEP mission for uranus and neptune

2 - for an important American company engaged in both the development of the SEP and the NEP (excluding missions too far from the sun, from Jupiter onwards) the SEP is worth up to 500 kW of power in addition to the nuclear

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336042067

page 3:
""AR has focused on SEP because currently all of the operational satellites using EP today use solar power. Thistrend is expected to continue as solar array designs become lighter, more robust and capable of generating morepower per unit area than they did a decade ago. In fact, up to power levels of about 300 kW – 400 kW, solar powerwill probably be the preferred alternative. Above 500 kW, there is a tradeoff between solar and nuclear power. Andthat is where the use of NEP designs starts to become viable. [...] AR currently has and is developing a variety of EP products that span from 3 to 13 kW, using varioustechnologies depending on the application. These include the flight XR-5 Hall thruster systems, the NEXT-C ionengine slated for flight on the NASA / APL DART mission in 2021, and the AEPS Hall thruster system planned fordemonstration on the NASA Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) in 2022.

"Genuine question, maybe this was asked before, if yes, sorry. I once saw a documentary about the curiosity and learned a lot about how it worked on mars, how they controlled it, and some craters that it photographed and gathered information. But one thing that stuck to me and wasn't answered is that, indeed on mars, the robot got, day by day, with a lot of dust on it. And it caused a real problem because it affected the performance of the solar panels. And with of the cold nights (as far as I remember/if I remember right), it could reach a moment in which the energy wouldn't be enough to heat the systems on stand by, waiting for the sun to rise, damaging the hardware and thus killing the Curiosity because of the low temperatures. My question is, why didn't they think about some kind of system that wipes, at least part, of the dust accumulated on top of the solar panels? It's such a problem that that's very hard, or impossible? Or maybe was just something that they didn't think of? Quite intrigued by this, since the documentary.

"So, yes and no.


Weight (force) is relative, but mass is not. The rover will always have ~900kg of mass wherever it goes, but will ""weigh"" differently depending on what planetary body it's stationed on.


This gets particularly annoying in the imperial measurement system because while kg is a unit of mass, saying something is X amount of pounds (lb) can be ambiguous as pounds are both unit of mass AND a unit of force (lbm vs lbf). Luckily NASA uses SI units in general which helps reduce the ambiguity, but they're still in the US so it's tough to break away from understanding everything through a lens of imperial measurements.


But to answer your question, the rover weighs about a third of what it did on Earth when it's on Mars, about 660 lbf.",0

"You may have learned of Kepler’s Law of Periods, P^2 =a^3 (period P is related to average distance a)? Well that law is only exactly true for our Sun. For other objects (such as the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter), it’s actually P^2 =k\*a^3 , where k can tell you the mass of the central object. For supermassive things like supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the formula needs more modifications for general relativity, but it’s the same idea.",0

"Depending on how old you are its quite likely that you will experience it. Nasa has a relatively planned out schedule. Because in about twenty to thirty years Mars will be for a short period be closer to earth, which of course reduces flight time and shit.

2024 came shortly thereafter, in what Pence called a political risk reduction. Pence recognized that these lunar plans are typically canceled by the next President in office, so if one President can pull it off, that’s better

So, NASA was not planning 2028 for a while. That was their initial response to the directive. They were then told that’s not fast enough, because a potential party change in 2025 would kill the program. Neither Trump nor Pence we’re wrong either, from all historical indication",0

Am currently down the rabbit-hole of Curiosity info I went down the last time an image like this came out.

There's almost no air pressure on Mars, the size and speed of those particles is negligible, they don't have the energy to move a cable.

I don't understand what you mean here, the cables are not under tension, they're actually quite flaccid with a few anchoring points here and there.

&gt;rocks smashing

The Martian ""wind"" has barely any capacity to lift minuscule sand particles, there are no ""flying rocks"" on Mars.

Vacuum cannot move stuff at all, vacuum is literally the absence of matter. You're thinking of explosive decompression, which requires a pressure gradient that doesn't exist on Mars. The interior of the rover is not pressurised.

First, mars dust is abrasive as hell. It's terrible on moving parts like the gimbal that mounts a blade. 

Second and probably bigger, mars dust will sand down and really scratch a solar panel that it's moved across by a pushing-and-pressing action from a wiper blade. So you're trading removal of one blocking agent with creation of another, permanent one.",0

"Dust settles down very lightly over everything over time on Mars. That's what created the original, pretty much perfectly even, film in the first pic.

Mars ""dust devils"" are really tiny, concentrated and fairly stable whirlwinds. Get a whirlwind passing directly overhead of something, and it picks up the dust under it and pulls it off, mostly sideways since that dust is heavier than air, but a tiny amount goes up into the vortex and makes it visible.

Since the solar tray is a little bit off the ground and quite smooth, the wind sweeps it fairly clear of dust, in the same way your blowing some spilled sugar off a smooth tablecloth clears it of sugar quite effectively. The removed dust then mostly falls to ground level and then blows along the surface, although a little could get sucked way up in the sky and fall everywhere over time.

Now as the dust devil leaves the rover, most of the dust that was on the rover's higher and smooth surface is lower than it is, and so very little gets redeposited on that surface, and so now it's cleaner. Instead, it's deposited on the sandy surface where there lots and lots of little nooks and crevices to capture it.",0

"I believe most nebulae are mostly pink-red to the naked eye, because the red hydrogen alpha emission line dominates all the other spectral emissions.

Bright nebulae would certainly be visible if you were close enough for them to have large angular extent. The brightest are a couple orders of magnitude brighter the Milky Way, in specific surface brightness.",0

"The data is all publically available and not hoarded.  There's raw image galleries for every camera on the rover where images are uploaded immediately after they're received ([example](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw-images/)), and there's similar galleries for every mission NASA does.  In the special case of the Juno mission all image processing is actually done by members of the public, all NASA does is provide the raw image files.  So all the cool Jupiter images you might have seen recently weren't made by NASA, NASA just gave people the data needed to make those images themselves.  And they did that because interest in space and science is increasing, not decreasing like you seem to be saying.

They also have a website called the [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/) where they have the raw data from every instrument on every mission available.  But it's not as user friendly as the image galleries because a lot less people are interested in massive tables of atmospheric pressure data and stuff.

"In a way, even the Hubble servicing missions were kind of a bit of play acting. The Shuttle was sold on the promise that it could be all things to all people, that's how it maintained funding through development. But that meant it had to be based on grandiose and unrealistic promises which it could never hope to achieve, especially not with the horribly compromised and overly complicated design that was produced.

But people were enthralled by the promises, and they pretended they represented reality, for a while. Everyone put their eggs in the Shuttle's basket, it became the primary launch system for all payloads in the ""free world"". Commercial, military, scientific, all of it. But in order to fulfill its promises the Shuttle would have to fly dozens of times a year too reach the cost figures. In practice NASA heavily subsidized launches and operations. In practice each launch cost around 1 to 2 billion, which none of the commercial customers could hope to pay.

But doing the missions gave the Shuttle a purpose and allowed room for the polite fiction that ""real soon now"" the Shuttle would hit it's stride and live up to its promise. That was part of the very pressure that resulted in the choice to launch Challenger, which ultimately revealed the fragility and limitations of the system, and brought down to Earth the really that it could never meet its promises, not by huge factors.

Hubble servicing missions continued, still hugely subsidized by NASA human spaceflight, partly because they showed off what astronauts could do and have some justification for keeping the Shuttle around.",0

"The term ""observable universe"" takes into account the positions of obects as they are today, not just the time it took for light to reach us. It isn't just that the light travels for 13.8 billion years. That only tells you how long ago the light left the object. They can observe the redshift and determine how fast the viewed object/galaxy is moving away from us. This is then used to determine how far away that object is *now*. It is how we can picture the universe as it looks today. The furthest objects are 46 billion light years away, and the furthest objects are moving away at a rate of more than 6 light years every year. That's the current limit of the observable universe. In time I think the top limit if the observable universe could expand to 60 billion? light years, but after that the speed of expansion beats light speed by a large factor. As space expands we won't be able to see those distant objects any longer.
 
 
 If the universe is infinite, there is a lot we will never see. But, if it is finite, and has a boundary, then it is possible for the entire universe to be *smaller* than the observable universe! Why? Light bends due to gravity, and we may be seeing some galaxies two or more times, in different parts of their development,and not realize it because the photons are taking different paths to get to us. In a closed system like that, you may even be able to view the Milky Way as it looked 10 billion years ago, but it may be unrecognizable because it would appear completely different than it is today.
 
 
Sorry if I didn't make sense. I am no expert, and may be mistaken. I just like space a lot and love to ponder these giant confusing concepts. The Wikipedia page on the Observable Universe is pretty hard to understand, but still fun to read. That is where I got a lot of my information.",0

It sounds really fucking stupid but I think this is where Space Force solves this issue. Originally NASA was part of the military and thus received that sweet sweet military money.

"For assessing where people could live we can approximate the coastline as about equal to the circumference of Mars (since the North is mostly ocean and the South is mostly land). Places like Tharsis would are less habitable than elsewhere, but places like Hellas basin might make more of the planet habitable if filled with water - so I think this is a reasonable approximation.

We can also approximate the typical distance from the coastline for the desert to be about 1000 km i.e. the distance from coast of China to the start of the Gobi desert. Obviously changing this number changes the final result.

Based on those two approximations, the ""habitable"" area of a terraformed Mars would be about 20 million square kilometers - or bit more than the land area of the USA and Canada combined.",0

The fact that we have put a remote control vehicle on the surface of a planet millions of miles away and have been using it to take pictures and study the planet all of the years later is amazing.  For all the people who bemoan humanity for being primitive and pathetic (which I will never understand), just looking at an example like this shows how incredibly far we have come and what we are capable of.  People 100 years ago may have figured we’d eventually get into space but if you told them we’d have a robotic vehicle on Mars being controlled by humans on Earth that was able to conduct experiments and take pictures, it would blow their minds.

"Data (radio signals) take anywhere from about 3 to 11 minutes to arrive on Earth from Mars, depending on the arrangement of each planet as they orbit the Sun. Data is transmitted by an antenna on the rover that is directed at Earth, and/or to two Mars orbiters that relay to Earth. As with all forms of light (electromagnetic radiation), radio waves do eventually disperse into the background, but at far greater distances than Mars to Earth. Radio waves from the Voyagers and New Horizons are still received here on Earth, albeit by very sensitive radio telescopes that can pick up their weak signals from so far out.",0

"As others pointed out, the difference is price range and development effort. A $20 000 car will be considerably less durable than a $2 500 000 000 rover.

Another important factor is the way it's used. For rovers, every single action is carefully planned and analysed prior to execution. Movement is slow, and equipment is used only to the necessary minimum. Normal cars and other stuff we use are subjected to relatively careless use by much less experienced people (us), so the deterioration is much greater. Earth's climate also plays a big role and accelerates parts damage.",0
"Rust is caused by the oxidation of iron.  While “oxidation” does not refer specifically to interactions with oxygen atoms (it’s a broad term related to chemical reactions), in the case of “rust” and iron, it does.

Given enough time and ample supply of oxygen, iron “structures” will eventually break down completely, leaving behind only iron oxide.",0

"Praise the cameraman. Dude's been up there taking pictures, and the bot has gotten all the cred.",0
"It most certainly wouldn’t.  Iron is very heavy while something like Titanium or Aluminum is not only lighter but also much stronger.  I’ve long worked as a chef and some places I’ve worked have used cast iron hot plates or pans and they are far heavier than the steel ones.  With our current launch system infrastructure that’s in place, weight reduction is one of the most important aspects of the vehicles and equipment we build for space travel or exploration.  It takes quite a bit of energy to get something small up to escape velocity or even orbital velocity, no less something that weighs thousands of pounds.

I’m sure in the future (as in the next 100 years, hopefully sooner), we will have engineered and built new launch systems and orbital infrastructure that will allow us to put much larger things into space than we do now and probably even be much easier than it is currently for us to put smaller payloads up there.  I personally think that infrastructure built on the Moon will eventually serve as staging area for long range journeys and probably even the place where these larger ships are built as the moon is dramatically easier to launch from due to the low gravity.  I’d love to see people on Mars and I’d likely be screaming and jumping around like a maniac when we all hear the first signal from the landing vehicle announcing “touchdown”.  I also think we will see a Mars mission in the next couple of decades, however I think we’d be better served by working to industrialize the moon in a serious manner before we attempt to send anyone to Mars, but the symbolism of it will likely outweigh the notion of building up the Moon for the time being.

I don’t think that those politicians pushing for a Mars mission currently have fully grasped just what we will need to develop in order to make it work and bring our people home successfully and healthy.  You’re going to need a spaceship with extensive radiation shielding for its crew and almost certainly will need a rotating section of the ship to create gravity unless our astronauts have no issue with permanently destroying their bodies to an extent (maybe even fatally) we have not yet seen in any of our other space travelers.  Scott Kelly spent a year in space (along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko) and was compared to his identical twin brother, Joe Kelly (also a retired astronaut) upon his return.  He suffered quite a bit of negative effects to his health due to being in space without gravity for so long.  The point is that despite the technology existing in the 1970s for a manned Mars mission, that even 50 years later, building your spaceship and equipment and planning out your mission is a very large undertaking, much larger than anything else we have done in regards to manned flights.  Getting to Mars with people will allow for more comprehensive scientific study of the planet and will prove that human beings are capable of traveling to (and surviving) other worlds (a major symbolic event, perhaps the biggest ever in our history) so it’s far from a wasted trip but Mars doesn’t exactly serve a useful purpose to us outside of what I mentioned.    Perhaps one day, it could be an exotic destination for Earthers looking to travel or settle elsewhere.  However, by the time we’re able to regularly move lots of people back and forth to Mars and establish a sustainable colony/base, I’m sure we will have the means to build space habitats that people could live on.  Other than being another planet that people may want to go to simply because it would be an exotic location or they want to live a “frontier” type life, I don’t think there will ever be a necessity for people to move to Mars to deal with overpopulation.

Most game developers choose to use the A* path-finding algorithm because it is popular, but it cannot handle dynamic objects without recomputing the entire path from scratch and implementations are often limited to 2 dimensions / basic grids.

NASA's JPL developed a new algorithm called D\*-lite and LPA\* which are simpler than A* to implement (in my opinion) and can handle both dynamic objects and 3 or more dimensions with ease, for use on the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.",0
"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not suggesting throwing some plants on the surface.

BUT, there will never be another exact copy of ""Earth"" within our own universe. (Meaning that even if complex organisms evolved like we did on a Earth-LIKE planet, they'd be totally different from humans and so would their history/society)

HOWEVER, according to multiverse theory there are infinite universes, each with their own distinct Earth [like our own but slightly(or largerly) different in one or more ways]. If you subscribe to multiverse theory there should also be infinite universes in which the Earth, our solar system, or even our Galaxy never formed.

It accumulates over time covering the cells but one day a bunch of wind kicks up to blow it clean off without actually resulting in the same dust just settling back over it as the wind died down.

The main thing about robots in space is not only do they pay off for many years like the rovers, the money you put in to research on better robots and AI the more that tech will advance tech here on earth, I would say any dollar you put in to that tech is going to pay you back later 100x.

"**Oxidizing agent**

In chemistry, an oxidizing agent (oxidant, oxidizer) is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances — in other words to accept their electrons. Common oxidizing agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the halogens.

In one sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that undergoes a chemical reaction in which it gains one or more electrons. In that sense, it is one component in an oxidation–reduction (redox) reaction.

"A few reasons:

There's basically nothing between us and the probe. About as much atmosphere as would be between you and someone a couple miles away and that's basically it.

Next, the transmitter on the probe transmits at several times the power of your cell phone.

That transmission is also pointed directly back at the earth in a fairly narrow beam, thanks to the big parabolic dishon the probe. Your phone broadcasts in all directions at once, wasting most of the energy.

On the receiving end here on earth, we listen to the signal using a network of *sixty-meter* parabolic collectors. So they gather a huge amount of signal from a very narrow slice of the sky. Cell phone antennas have a vastly smaller collecting area and are non-directional.

The oscillators, DACs, etc. on each end are extremely high quality and produce a very stable, clean signal.

That signal also doesn't have to share the region of the radio spectrum with a ton of other cell phones and devices. The transmitter and receiver are only listening to each other at any given moment, like having a one-on-one conversation in a quiet room.

To send a signal back to the probe, the system works the same in reverse, but we can transmit with much higher power to ensure that the probe's smaller receiver dish can hear it clearly.

Now, despite all this the datarates at the distance that New Horizons is at are *extremely slow* -- perhaps 1,000 or 2,000 bits per second. We would never tolerate such slow speeds from our phones, but it's necessary for distant probes to ensure that the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough we can hear the probe (and the probe can hear us!) above the background noise.",0

"Yep, most American made cars by Ford and GM during this time period were actually dog shit, except for their trucks and large vehicles. I can personally attest to this as I had a 05 Malibu that shit the bed every other month with some issue.

"IIRC they landed other rovers using balloons, but not Curiosity. 


Curiosity is a massive rover and weighs just shy of a ton. It's like landing a small car from space. Balloons weren't going to cut it for this one, especially with the added complexity.


So what did NASA/JPL decide to do? A fucking [Sky Crane](https://youtu.be/h2I8AoB1xgU). Not only do you have to get this thing built, launched on a 9 month journey from Earth to Mars, and inserted correctly in a Martian orbit, which is a MASSIVE technical achievement in its own right, but then you have to land the damn thing. And instead of balloons, it has a whole separate descent stage that slows the rover down to the point where it's hovering above the Martian surface. The rover pops out of this assembly and is lowered with cables to the ground, and then the ""crane"" flies away. If it gets too close and kicks up too much debris, it's game over for the science sensors on the rover. If it has too much horizontal speed when dropping the rover, game over. If things get tangled or it accidentally clips the rover - game over.


Not only did it work flawlessly, it did it autonomously. On Mars. Hundreds of millions of miles away. Just the sheer complexity of it all gets me every time.",0

Things aren't designed to fail 90% of the time (excluding protective failure) rather they are designed to fall within a price range which means using cheaper materials.,0
"The cosmic radiation problem is a very big one, and may not have a good solution. The health effects of a 9 month trip through deep space could leave explorers dealing with malignant cancers when they arrive ready to do their exploring, not to mention vision damage and muscle/bone loss from the microgravity.

Isolation is not something to take lightly. We're social animals. Solitary confinement has serious long term effects on your mental health, which is why it's being banned in many prisons.

In the case of a mars mission, you wouldn't be alone though. You'd have your crew with you, but putting 4 or 5 people in extremely tight quarters, completely isolated from the rest of humanity, in an extremely dangerous situation, with a very heavy workload, could potentially lead to a breakdown of the command structure, as we saw with the skylab mutiny. A bunch of physically fit 20-somethings trapped in close proximity, completing complex/stressful tasks is a common setup for reality TV shows, and that's for good reason. It's a situation where people break down quickly. People turn on one another, couples form, cliques and alliances happen, and drama flourishes.

Nasa is taking these issues pretty seriously. There's a cool podcast called The Habitat where they gave a training group of astronaut hopefuls recorders to talk about their experiences in a simulated mars base if you're curious about it. 

I'm not saying a mission to mars is impossible, but it may simply be unrealistic due to all the hurdles we'll need to jump over. Eventually we might invent elegant solutions to every problem using yet-unseen technologies, but that could be decades, or even centuries away. I just don't want people to get their hopes up for people to be on mars by 2030. Looking at problems realistically saves you from a lot of disappointment. With all the challenges involved, and the lack of evidence of life so far, I just don't see any country throwing tens of billions at the problem. If the mars 2020 rover arrives and digs up a fossil, or finds microbes in the soil, funding could cease to be an issue due to the immense public interest it would generate though. Fingers crossed.",0

&gt;Ngl I wouldn't want the US to spend 25 billion going to Mars when we got starving people at home

"Many of these missions' life expectancies are actually set shorter than what they plan and then they extend the mission later. This is because in case there is a catastrophic problem that ends the mission, they can still say the mission outlived it's original goal and thus the mission is not deemed a failure. 

For example, the rover is actually expected to last 5 years but they say it is a 2 year mission. The rover dies in year 3 due to unforeseen circumstances but the mission is classified as a success. If they said it was a 5 year mission then it would have died 2 years quicker than expected making it a failure. Many successful missions helps maintain funding because it's a lot easier to fund a space agency with a higher mission success rate.",0

There's still more than in Earth's atmosphere if my quick maths is correct. Earth's atmosphere is 100 times thicker but Mars' CO2 percentage is 2375 times higher (95% vs 0.04%),0
Curiosity still communicates by and large slower than dialup. It can connect with Earth directly at 32kbit/s or using sat links it can reach 256kbit/s or 2000kb/s but only for 8 minute bursts as the satellite passes overhead which amounts to 0.56% of the time.,0

"Automotive engineer here. Everything is built to satisfy a set of requirements. Think of it like a set of nested folders on a computer. The top level folders would be wide reaching requirements like lifespan, temperature extremes, weight, etc. Under that folder would be the camera, under that, a control arm, under that a motor, under that a armature, under that wire, under that, copper material.

You can see that it's like a massive hierarchy of all the parts that need to go together to build the rover.  Now, each subfolder needs to meet the requirements of it's parent. This way, you can say that the lifespan of the rover needs to be 7 years, and it'll trickle down through the hierarchy to every sub component. The company supplying the copper will certify with standardised testing methods it meets the requirements of the wire maker, the same all the way up. Lots of testing at every stage.  Eventually you have a vast supply chain with an enormous paper trail that is controlled within specialist computer programs by specialist people.

A lot of parts are outsourced, you can do this easily if you have thoroughly written requirements.  The engineering of something like the rover is the result of a huge communication of engineers all over the world.",0

"&gt; It's fascinating how long these missions can carry out after the planned lifecycle is exceeded.

They are designed to last a fuck of a lot longer.

1. NASA: we need funding for a mission
2. government: how long?
3. NASA: about 90 days
4. government: ok here's some money
5. NASA: as luck would have it this perky cute machine has outperformed the initial operating parameters by 10,000% since it's already there can we have a bit more money to keep it going?",0
Imagine if your car cost as much as this rover.,0
Curiosity is just fine. It just learned to adapt to the Martian culture by tanning itself.,0
"Wait, do people think the Mars robot stuff is fake too? I thought we were just arguing about humans on the moon, not the whole space exploration program. TIL.",0
Fun story! My professor helped design systems for this when he was at JPL!,0

An important plot point in _The Martian!_ Atmosphere is thin enough that dude yeets himself off the planet with his ascent vehicle covered with a tarp.,0
"It's definitely not impossible at all. You'll see people land on Mars in your lifetime. I would personally give up everything, drop my life and all of my plans, and go be the first to explore mars with zero hesitation. Even if it were a one way trip that came to an end shortly after completing my assigned tasks. I don't see loneliness as a concern at all. Id be too busy crying out of greatfullness for the whole experience to be bothered with loneliness. There are a lot of others out there that share the same sentiment as me.

 I agree we need to get on a moon base too, though.",0
THATS why I couldn’t see the stick... I have been wondering where it was every time I have seen a photo from the rover. Thanks.,0
"Yep. Someone needs to blast it with an air hose, and I bet it would look good as new.",0
"Cause there is no rust, the thing is just covered in dust. It's not made of steel or iron, so there should be no brown rust. If the rovers were corroding that much that fast, they would not be lasting as long as they have been. Also the resolution on this picture isn't great to look at the details and should go over to NASA to see full resolution.",0
Seeing these pictures showing land makes it hard to believe theres no life on it so far.,0
"This is exactly what I was wondering, thank you.",0
Looks like my car after not washing it for 7 days in Australia.,0
That's just a tiny scientist,0
Not in the Ford Focus corner of the auto industry.,0
Why is the image cropped like that? To hide it’s location?,0
"The only reason we do it on vehicles on earth is because it looks better. A lot of the underside of vehicles, where all the mechanical components are, remain uncovered even now.

(Aerodynamics aside - even then we were covering all that stuff on vehicles long before aerodynamics were known to really be all that important - and that's a negligible factor on mars with little atmosphere and the rover's low speed)",0
How we dont have point of refference then?,0
"I love the signature [nameplate](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA15883_hires.jpg) on it. A lot’s happened in 7 years when science was still a priority, NASA was respected, and the interest in space hadn’t switched from exploration to a space-army battlefield.",0

Dumb guy here but do we know if Mars has any usable minerals?,0
Are.... Are those footprints 👣 on the left side?,0
What's with the footprints in the first image?,0
Not from MCO. If you are around titusville/cocoa you hear the rumble as it goes up and then if the main booster lands at the cape then you heard the sonic boom. I think it is a twin sonic boom. I have only seen the Falcon 9 once from Cocoa (highway 528). When the shuttle landed at the cape you hear two quick booms like 1/2 second apart when it is near. Sometimes you could hear it in Orlando depending on the shuttle flight path.,0
"Its looks like plain old desert vista we have hear on earth just with orange filter.

"I imagine there'll be a monument to it someday, it'll be a historic site in the future.",0
"Just out of curiosity, who is taking These pictures of the curiosity",0
"Pretty much correct.  You can bet they thought of, analyzed, and tested for every possible thing that those wires (called wiring harness) would conceivably be exposed to, and gave them enough protection (with safety margin built in), but not more than enough as mass is critical especially on an interplanetary mission like this.  More protection on that harness than necessary means less capability to do science ultimately, as there's only so much mass to go around.

One other point is that for the things like the legs/arms that deploy, the harness needs to be able to flex.  In those scenarios you want it to be as flexible as possible (i.e. not wrapped in a million layers of ""protection"" if not needed), and you also don't want it hanging up on things (like a rigid shield around it) which could make the deployment (and possibly the mission) fail.",0
It's been seven years?! It feels like I watched the spectacular landing video last week...,0
Always think about that haha,0
"Most of their pictures are not edited, only the edited ones get posted here. You can go see them all on NASA's website.",0

"this is it, humanity has officially peaked.

IIRC they also had to slow down quite a lot as they couldn't trust the automatic pathing any more.,0
"I'm curious (ha) if they write a plaque that says ""this is from earth, we come in peace"" type of thing?",0
They can't take a picture of what's directly under the camera so that's a bit edited. Look at the tire tracks on the ground,0
"Just think, when Curiosity first landed, ""selfie"" wasn't even a commonly used word.",0
The camera is on an arm which is removed from the photo.,0
Not pictured here are the trail of dead cats this Rover has done in over the years,0
Is it true you hear the sonic boom?,0
"Agreed. I'd like to see a major international effort to get to Mars.

We may have to face a sad reality though: Getting to mars might just be unrealistic. The cosmic radiation is a problem we currently don't have any solution for, so anyone who takes the trip is putting their health in serious jeapordy. Once there, the planet isn't particularly welcoming. Poison soil, lack of air, lack of water, and the explorers would be extremely isolated from any outside help. Any mission would span years, and the psychological effects of isolation for that long could be downright traumatic.

I love the idea of going to Mars, but it may simply not be feasable. A much better goal for now would be permanently inhabiting the moon. Natural caves could provide adequate protection from radiation, and the moon's resources have a ton of potential uses, including fueling rockets for missions further out into the solar system. The moon would give us a testbed for all the technology we'd need on Mars, and is close enough that the astronauts could get home in a few days if something went wrong. Plus being in constant real-time contact with earth would have a lot of benefits.",0
Thank you for pointing out the flaw in my business concept. I'll go back to the drawing board ... :(,0
I would like to see this color corrected.  It looks like everything in the right side is redder.,0
If the roamer has been roaming around away from the pod thing it landed with how is the photo been taken?,0

God that is awesome. Right past your back yard,0
Now I see why Elon is so into space and stuff,0
So someone please explain how the pics were taken? I don't see an arm extending a camera in either picture?,0
"Cars benefit from a thick atmosphere that screens almost all of the sun's UV radiation, which is the most harmful part of solar radiation.

I'm thinking you don't appreciate just how much harsher Mars environment is compared to a desert on Earth.  Continuous high-band UV radiation is very damaging.",0
"I think it would cause the *planet* to dissipate into space. If gravity lets up, at the equator, all that magma pressure that makes volcanoes work would kick in, all at once.",0

"Wait so, someone is on Mars. Like. Rn. Holy crap I'm so excited I'm shitting",0
Was looking for this explanation. Thank you.,0
"I learned today that the reason the stars were not visible is due to the exposure level of the camera. It's the same phenomena at play when you look up at the stars for several minutes and eventually see more stars. Also the same principle when pointing a telescope at the sun without a filter. You would see no sun spots, solar flares, just blinding light.

If the camera on the moon was configured to capture the stars, the moon would be so bright you'd only see a massive white blob, and no astronauts, no lander vehicle. Just a massive white blinding blob. The moons surface is highly reflective, so much so that moonlight is a thing, bright enough to create light in the darkness. That's due to the reflective surface.",0

Yeah. You want to reflect as little of the heat back into space as possible.,0
I’m guessing that’s not rust on curiosity but dust that’s built up over the years.,0
Well no disrespect intended but I’d take NASA a hell of a lot more seriously if most of their pictures were not manipulated. I’d rather see a picture in its original form rather than a composite or edit.,0
"**Radioisotope thermoelectric generator**

A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG, RITEG) is an electrical generator that uses an array of thermocouples to convert the heat released by the decay of a suitable radioactive material into electricity by the Seebeck effect. This generator has no moving parts.

RTGs have been used as power sources in satellites, space probes, and uncrewed remote facilities such as a series of lighthouses built by the former Soviet Union inside the Arctic Circle. RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred watts (or less) of power for durations too long for fuel cells, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where solar cells are not practical.

"Sort of! Not a full-on nuclear power plant, but just [a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator), i.e. a lump of radioactive material which naturally gives off heat, which is then converted into electricity.

The radiation they emit is alpha particles, which is pretty safe (can't even penetrate skin) as long as you don't eat it, and it's not like Mars is a stranger to radiation anyway. They're too low-power and too expensive for most applications on Earth, but [they're a hilariously great solution for space probes.](https://xkcd.com/2115/)",0

Ngl I wouldn't want the US to spend 25 billion going to Mars when we got starving people at home.

Mars' atmospheric pressure seems to be around 1% of Earth's sea level pressure so the atmosphere is very very thin there,0
"Yeah... but that’s still “localized,” right? And I said 10-15 miles. So, closer to your 40km estimate. And, it’s snow. To have nice green terrain, you’d need warm air and moderate rain. Again, the Great Lakes don’t have the effect that’s needed to control climate like the other commenter said. It’s weather. It’s localized. 

It goes back to my original point.. mountain ranges, wind patterns and planetary rotation have a larger effect on inland climates than “distance from ocean.”",0

"There’s really no need to. Things like that are protected here on earth due to corrosion and other environmental factors due to our climate. There’s nothing like that on Mars so no need to waste valuable mass covering things up. The more things you cover up the more mass you need.

"So their current rocket, the Ariane 6, is non reusable and therefore obsolete (except in the case of payloads that can't fit in a falcon heavy fairing). They won't be able to land the first stage of a rocket until 2030 when the ""Ariane Next"" launches. By then, Starship will be flying, and probably a couple of iterations into its development.

"You are still missing the point. I'm not just talking about human life. I'm talking all types of life, even bacteria. I'm not assuming, I'm stating the facts, they are  essential to our life. The entire post wasn't made to look at what would happen if one factor of the solar system wouldn't be here during evolution, this post is about the PRESENT, and how it's all essential to all the life currently on this planet. You can't say the moon isn't essential to life when it could affect coastal ecosystems and it's predators, because those are living beings. If Jupiter dissapeared right now, then celestial bodies wouldn't be pulled away anymore and would cause death, or even extinction if it hit earth, when I corrected you in your mistake of saying every planet had a sun, you took it the wrong way. The word ""sun"" is unique to our star,  the words ""solar system"" is unique to our planets orbiting our star. I was never wrong about that. You don't call the star Sirius a ""sun"" now do you? No. When I posted this I assumed that people would  think deeper a little bit, but just to clarify, it is essential to OUR life right now, never said that it was essential if we evolved without these factors, only that we wouldn't have made it far enough to evolve into what we are today. In conclusion, I've made my point, there is no reason to debate anymore, it is pointless, no mentions of unevolved life in my post, only how it all works together for earth to harbor life, unintentionally.",0

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact\_(1997\_American\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film))

it's a reasonable scenario, since the book was written by Carl Sagan.... 

who just happened to be involved in the design of the aforementioned plaque.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. **Together with** [**Frank Drake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake) **he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by** [**Linda Salzman Sagan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Salzman_Sagan)**, who was Sagan's wife at the time.**",0
"I could figure as much.  But, look at the pic on the right.  No stick.  No shadow.  Or, am I missing it?",0
And it's only driven 13 miles in that whole time,0
Can't be. I remember watching the landing like a few months ago.,0
"Tidal forces between the spinning Earth and the Moon are adding energy to the Moon's orbit, which moves it further away from Earth, and being further away means it orbits slower. This additional energy in the Moon's orbit is actually speeding it up, but going faster takes it further from the Earth, where a circular orbit has more potential energy (a fall straight down would release more energy) but less kinetic energy (the object moves more slowly).",0
"You're right, it's not a conspiracy theory.  Wind blows dust off as well as on, so the amount remains fairly constant.  The conspiracy theory is that it's mysterious, it isn't at all.",0

"NASA could probably start a go fund me or Kickstarter type deal, and raise enough to send someone to Mars right now. 

I know I’d donate like $500 if they did that.",0

"I dunno why I never realized curiosity probably had a generator, solar panels are useless there and so are turbines",0
Not bad at all. Something outside tor 7 years would look worse on Earth.,0
Between 4 and 13 minutes according to google,0
Native Martians helped https://imgur.com/IiUxAHU.jpg,0
But why?,0
"Corrosion would be rare due to the low levels of oxygen and moisture in the atmosphere. I don’t see the rust in the picture, but the increased exposure to radiation could amplify the corrosion.",0
"When 7 years on Mars you reach, look as good you will not.",0
"The arm isn't there because they only combined the sections of each picture without the arm in it, otherwise you would see sections of the arm all across the image in different places.",0

"Many think terraforming Mars is beyond our ability. I think we can. We are currently terraforming Earth, just not how we want to. Humans are having a global impact.",0
Who's footprints are those in the left picture?!?!,0
I mean per unit volume compared to here or just in % of the overall atmosphere?,0
Also where is this arm you speak of? Nothing extends outward of the frame. If they edited it out does that not mean they are in fact manipulating their pictures?,0
"Some of it looks pretty excessive for 7 years though? I've seen cars sit in the desert for 20 years and look better and they are just cheap sheet metal...

Definitely not going tin foil hat just seems like a crazy amount of corrosion on materials that are presumably top grade nickel/titanium alloy and anodized aluminum in a desert like environment even accounting for solar radiation.

Even the rubber/foam insulation over some of the cables is completely disintegrated...",0

"Well, the budget for Curiosity (a single rover, mind you) was 2.5 billion dollars. That money is used for problems exactly like that one. edit: not an engineer or anything",0

Curiosity at least isn't solar powered. It has a generator with nuclear fuel.,0
The ultra sharp dust is incomparable though.,0
Luckily the advance mission with the bouncy castle and paddling pool were a complete success and managed to get in position in time.,0
"Imagine being teleported there and that fraction of a second before you realize that something is very, very wrong.",0
There’s a lot of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere. Just has to be freed from those pesky carbon atoms.,0
Hold up.... there’s a nuclear generator on that thing?!,0
Actually looks better than I thought it would,0
"Nice! I'm wondering why this got so little coverage, that's basically a confirmation!

I don't even recall seeing the article in the PC Gamer page and I check it regularly.",0
That's a nice tan from being out in the sun that long.,0
"Yeah there's a delay, in the minutes range not hours or anything. They don't command them in the sense of like someone controlling it with a joystick, I believe it's more like they plot out a course for it (they have detailed maps of the Martian surface thanks to orbiters) and give it a route to take. I'm sure there are failsafes so that it can use its sensors to detect if NASA is accidentally going to drive it into a ditch or something.",0
"I wonder if I live long enough to see a Museum of Mars History with Curiosity on display with the rovers.

I doubt it but you know that's going to happen.",0
Wow. Pretty psyched about the launch. Thanks for your help.,0
"woah.. well, lucky for Mars it doesn't suit our needs. We would ruin it, too.",0
"Two questions.

1) I'm guessing the landing platform took the first picture.  What took the second one?

2) in the picture on the left. . .Are those footprints??",0
"I laughed at this, then remembered Iam wearing a dickies shirt from 2001.",0
"why does it look wet? Look at the cables along the top.

Assembly lube of some kind, maybe? It looks like it’s oily more so than water/moisture to me. 

Cool pic nonetheless.

"If we actually had a focus on science and NASA we could do it in our lifetimes imo. It's just right now everybody wants NASA and nobody wants to fund it. Hell, even our NASA museums preach the benefit of privatizing space and pushing more space efforts onto businesses. It's kind of disgusting to me, since so much of these advances are driven by pure human curiosity, not the profit drive. Right now the private sector might be testing space flight to get in the news, but once it becomes viable it will all be mining and tourism and whatever they can do to make money. Science only has value to them so far as it gets them more cash, and these rovers are not profitable.",0
This is why state sponsored exploration is so important. SpaceX and provate companies will NEVER be able to do this.,0

Thanks for the reply. I’m just genuinely curious. I’m not saying NASA fakes all their photos I’m just saying that some of them appear odd and oddly not very realistic. I have no frame of reference because I’ve never been to space.,0
"&gt;the moon is crucial for life

No it isn't.  It's crucial for some ecosystems on earth, but only because they adapted themselves to the existence of the moon.  If the moon wasn't there they'd just adapt themselves to the nonexistence of the moon,

&gt;I meant as in their extremely strong gravitational pull helps maintain life, if there was no Jupiter, we wouldn't die, because we would never be born, the gaseous planet has caught comets and asteroids in the past that would've destroyed life on earth.

Jupiter may have deflected asteroids and comets in the past, but there's also evidence it caused mass extinctions by sending them towards us.  The influence of Jupiter has been massively overblown by a lot of space documentaries.  And the other planets do even less, you could erase all of them from existence and nothing would change for us.

&gt;atmosphere protects us from radiation and the extreme heat the sun emits

Without an atmosphere the earth would be colder, not hotter.  The atmosphere traps the heat.  Also life can be very resistant to radiation if it needs to be.

&gt;And lastly, not every planet has a sun. They have a star. 

The sun is a star, a star is a sun.  Every star gives off light and heat and allows for photosynthesis.  So every planet has an equivalent to the sun, even if it's obviously not the same one as ours.

It seems like what you're doing is looking at all the characteristics of earth and assuming they're all essential to life.  They're not.  Many of them didn't even exist when life formed, or at least not in the same way.  I completely understand the premise of the post, my point is that these factors aren't acting together and aren't essential to each other, or necessarily essential for life.  Some of them are essential for life on earth, but only because life on earth evolved to require them.  If they weren't there life on earth would have just evolved to not require them.

There's even life on earth right now that doesn't require most or all of these factors.  The stuff that lives at deep ocean trenches would survive if earth didn't have a sun, a moon, or an atmosphere.  Those ecosystems would survive for billions of years if the earth was flung completely out of the solar system.  And the reason it doesn't require those factors is they don't apply to the bottom of the ocean, so that life didn't evolve to require them.",0
"The surface of the rovers is costatnly bombarded with solar radiation that can cause corrosion, plus there are still small trace amounts of reactive chemicals in the atmosphere and the dust that can cause corrosion over time.

Why bother with the titanic task of transforming a planet when you could just build made-to-order habitats, with exactly the terrain you need/want, that can *comfortably* support a population of trillions.

They don't look fake, you just have no other frame of reference for what a real rover on Mars looks like besides movies and television which actually *are* fake so maybe it's because you're comparing it to that.

This word gets thrown around a lot, but it's essentially just taken similar to how your phone's panorama feature works by stitching together several pictures.

All of them are real unless they're indicated as an artist's interpretation or animation. Those labels don't always make it to Reddit posts but the source of pictures is always clearly defined on NASA's sites.

Charon, also known as (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It has a mean radius of 606 km (377 mi). It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).

With half the diameter and one eighth the mass of Pluto, Charon is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body.

"When I listed those things, I wasn't asking for a full explanation, because I already know most of what you have wrote down, I was basically asking everyone if it seems bizzare, strange, coincidental, amazing etc to them as it does to me that all those factors work together for life to basically happen. Firstly without the moon the tides would lessen which wouldn't affect us, but it would greatly affect coastal ecosystems survival which then would affect land mammals, the absence of the moon would affect the weather insanely, the moon is crucial for life. Secondly, the other planets, I meant as in their extremely strong gravitational pull helps maintain life, if there was no Jupiter, we wouldn't die, because we would never be born, the gaseous planet has caught comets and asteroids in the past that would've destroyed life on earth. Thirdly, yes oxygen comes from plant life, but my point was that no matter how rare, the atmosphere protects us from radiation and the extreme heat the sun emits. And lastly, not every planet has a sun. They have a star. And yes, the sun is crucial for life, photosynthesis wouldn't occur without it, and of course the Goldilocks zone isn't rare, before commenting, please think about the intentions of the post. Which was in fact for everyone to comment on what they think about this situation, that everything in our solar system works together. Nothing is unique about the sun, the Goldilocks zone or the planets, what's unique is the entire solar system harbouring these factors and making each one of them essential to each other.

In spite of this, I actually see Venus as being a better candidate for terraforming than Mars, as Venus's mass allows it to hold on to lighter gasses (such as nitrogen and oxygen, but especially water vapor, ammonia, and methane) that would be lost on Mars simply because of [gas molecules reaching escape velocity solely due to temperature (Jean's escape)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean's_escape).",0

Curiosity was initially on a two year mission, but have been extended indefinitely. The rover is still operational, and as of January 26, 2020, Curiosity has been on Mars for 2656 sols.


It's fascinating how long these missions can carry out after the planned lifecycle is exceeded. The rover Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to exceed its operating plan by 14 years, 46 days (in Earth time), 55 times its designed lifespan.",0

"&gt;Let's say we wanted to launch a payload of pure metal (perhaps 500 lb of titanium) into orbit

One thing to note before starting: the projectile should have some small amount of propulsion on board to raise its periapsis otherwise most trajectories will leave you escaping lunar orbit entirely or crashing back into the ground

&gt; What kind of power would the mass driver need 

Depending on exactly what kind of orbit you want that lump of metal to end up in it should take somewhere in the neighborhood of a few gigajoules of energy

&gt;and what length should it be in order to deliver the payload? 

For a solid block of titanium it could be quite short, a longer acceleration keeps the g-forces lower so you need a longer gun if you want to launch more delicate objects

&gt;Do we have the kind of technology to do this currently?

We have working rail gun technology, presumably rail gun technology can be scaled up to any size we want if you had enough money to develop and build it.",0

So an ""asteroid warning system"" is just more telescopes dedicated to asteroid tracking.",0

"&gt;the moon for tides

Some life on earth requires tides, but tides aren't required for life in general.

&gt;the other planets for earth's gravity and to catch asteroids

I'm not sure what you mean by ""for earths gravity"", the other planets have nothing to do with that.  And while Jupiter does keep the asteroid belt in check, it's also possible for it to fling asteroids towards the inner solar system.

&gt;oxygen and the atmosphere to keep radiation at bay and give us a comfortable temperature

We don't know how rare thick atmospheres are, that might not be particularly special.  And oxygen wasn't always there, it was actually created in the atmosphere by life after photosynthesis evolved.

And every solar system has a goldilocks zone, that's not unique at all.  Even in our solar system Mars is also in the goldilocks zone.

"I saw a science documentary quite a while back, probably in the mid-2000s, where they'd given some CGI artist the job of animating exactly the phenomenon shown in your gif: Two large objects in orbit around each other, one larger than the other, with both being very obviously affected by each other.

Unfortunately, whoever told the CGI artist what to animate had made the mistake of assuming the artist would have the intuition to understand how such a phenomenon works out in physical reality.

So the result we got—which, again, is literally what they showed in this documentary on Discovery or whatever—was both planets in orbit on the _same side_ of the center of gravity.  In perfect sync.  All while the narrator is dutifully explaining the phenomenon as if your gif was playing.

This can't have been very useful to anyone relying on the program to be educational.",0

"Physicist here.

You're neglecting to include a term for the cross-section of a neutrino. The 1e45 watts of energy you're talking about is carried by neutrinos, which interact lightly with matter (to put it.... lightly). If the energy was to be delivered by something like EM radiation (which interacts strongly with matter), you may have more grounded fears of being toasted. Neutrinos mostly just blast right through us without transferring any energy. For example, we can run the same calculation with solar flux.

Most of the neutrino flux on earth comes from the sun. Roughly 1e15 per square meter per second. The energy of the bulk of these is roughly in the 400keV range. If we convert this to energy flux, it comes to about 64W/m\^2.

But the absorption rate of neutrinos in an atom which interacts ""strongly"" with neutrinos is roughly 10 SNU (solar neutrino units)  
[http://www.sns.ias.edu/\~jnb/Papers/Popular/Scientificamerican69/scientificamerican69.html](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/Papers/Popular/Scientificamerican69/scientificamerican69.html)  
A SNU is one capture per second per 1e36 atoms.

Let's then use this number to determine how much of that 64 W/m\^2 from the sun is absorbed by a cubic meter of seawater (assuming all atoms of the water absorbed neutrinos as strongly). 1 cubic meter of water contains roughly 1e29 atoms. Divide that by the SNU and we get an expected 1 detection every 1e7 seconds. The number of neutrinos blasting through it is 1e15/s. The fraction of neutrinos which interact with that 1 cubic meter is then 1/1e15\*1e7 = 1e-22.

For the sun's output, that would mean a 1m\^3 volume of water would not absorb the full 64W, but only about 6e-21 W.

Apply this absorption rate to the neutrino flux at the surface of the earth from Betelgeuse blowing up, and the power is reduced from 2e6 W/m\^2 to 2e-16W/m\^2.

I think we'll be fine.",0

You have to remember that terraforming Mars will be flash flooding on a global scale for centuries. The craters will have to fill up with water and the sediment it carries before they can start draining.

"&gt; Is there a reason why the GRS has existed for ~340 years while the other storms don’t?

Again, not a storm, but...

It's heavily debated and likely will never be known if the GRS has actually stuck around for 355 years. Robert Hooke saw something that looked very much like the GRS in 1664, and Giovanni Cassini definitely saw it in 1665.

However, it's heavily debated if it was the *same* Great Red Spot back then, or a separate vortex. It was observed continuously from 1665 until 1713, when suddenly the region clouded over and the vortex was not seen again for over a century.

The Great Red Spot was suddenly spotted again in 1830, and has been observed continuously until today...but again, was it the same vortex that Cassini saw? Or did the old one dissipate and a new one form a century later? Is there something particularly long-lived about the vortex, or is there just something about that region of the planet that spawns giant vortices? We currently do not know the answer to these questions.",0

"We have a good idea because the south pole of Earth is also landlocked - just not *as* landlocked as the South pole of Mars would be. Essentially, snow can fall there but never sublimates (or melts and evaporates) so the ice sheet gets thicker and thicker until its so thick that no more precipitation can fall on it.

98% of Antarctica is covered in at least a mile of ice, so we'd see something like that around the South pole of Mars.

For example, I'm 99% sure you guessed wrong about the Sahara's location. On that region, you don't expect a desert, but a tropical rain forest (they form a belt around the equator). And it was there less than 10 thousand years ago (same happens with a few other deserts too, and we are not talking about known human activity doing it).

"Volume is what they mean I would assume.

With a radius of 6371 km, earth's volume should be around 1.08321 * 10^12 cubic kilometers using the 4/3 * pi * radius^3 formula for volume of a sphere.


If jupiters solid part had a diameter of 32000 (radius then being 16000), it would have a volume of 1.71573 * 10^13 cubic km.


(1.71573E+13)/(1.08321E+12) = 15.84...


So the diameter they gave for Jupiter's body would make its volume almost 16 times that of earth.",0
"Probably a stupid response, but wouldn't the solar wind just blow it all away?",0
That's a sentence I never thought I'd read. It's certainly not a sentence I'd ever think I would agree with.,0

"Terraforming Mars is estimated to take 50 to 100 millions of years. Right in the range of the highly erroded Chicxulub crater. 

And where is the water going to come from is it going to rain or just ooze up through the ground? Any bit of rain will move the Martian regolith. All but the most robust features on Mars will be eroded like a sand castle at the beach. Just think of how much soil is moved during flooding on Earth and multiply that by 1000s of years of rain required to fill that ocean.

Edit: spelling",0
If you squint you can kind of pretend this is the view from a telescope scrolling across the desert,0
Except that erosion would have a field day with those coast lines.,0

**Image Details**

A solar prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the sun's surface. Prominences are anchored to the sun's surface in the photosphere (sun's visible surface), and extend outwards into the sun's hot outer atmosphere, called the corona.

It was a challenging day when I captured this. Seeing conditions were not ideal. This animation was captured over a 65 minute period and contains 95 frames.

Follow me on Instagram [**@chucksastrophotography**](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) if you would like to know what's possible to be captured from our own backyard and the telescopes I use.

This is a [**video walkthrough**](https://youtu.be/_H1t5dNY1Wc) of my solar setup.

"When this has come up before a few things are generally noted:

* Tharsis would be a very dry, cold desert even after terraforming.

* The Southern ice cap would probably be very big since the South pole is very landlocked - even moreso than our own.

* A lot of the rest of Mars would have intense and extensive monsoon seasons because of the temperature difference between the land in the South and the ocean in the North.

* The Boreal Ocean would probably end up with very large storms compared to the oceans of Earth, because of the lack of land North of 50 degrees latitude.

It's not clear what the climate around Hellas or Argyre Planitia would be - it would depend on how big the Southern ice cap gets.

The other thing affecting how Mars would look from space would be the colour of the vegetation picked. If we wanted to decrease the planet's albedo, for example, we might want to select for plants which have very dark coloured leaves.",0

Hmm would it not be too cold still for most plant life?,0
"Erode the craters? What part? Eroding then will just make them bigger? And that will take at least millions of years, probably billions for any sizeable change/expansion in the craters(Mars is made of basalt rock, an igneous rock). The edges of lakes are hardly being eroded, now imagine that, but on an extremely erosionally resistant rock. Keeping in mind most igneous rocks on coasts have recession rates in the scale of millimetres per year.",0

Then I was excited about NASA sending humans to the Moon and beyond with SLS/Orion.  I was frustrated and confused to see it needlessly complicated with a useless space station in orbit around the Moon.


I investigated both of these and found the common thread:  SEP was forced into both missions and that is what ruined them.


Then I was reading Stern and Grinspoon's new book about New Horizons, and I learned that years before Lunar Gateway and Asteroid Redirect, NASA was pushing SEP on the Pluto mission and suddenly I saw that this was a decades-long pattern of interfering with missions by forcing SEP into them.  It was no longer a coincidence but a plain truth.  I was so flabbergasted that I wrote this essay about it.  Thanks for reading and discussing it with me.",0
"Long long ago the universe was much denser. So, the region from where the light was emitted was much closer to this region where we are sitting now observing it.

And if the universe was not expanding the light would have reached and passed our region billions of years ago already.

But as the universe is expanding and as light travels at speed of light, then in an expanding universe the light had to travel much much longer journey to reach us. That's why we see it only now. 

Regarding FTL: It's not that the light would be here too early, it's that the light is here only now. The light took much longer to reach us because the universe was expanding in between and the journey became longer.",0

"&gt; Is this established protocol when calculating axial rotation? 

It's established protocol for gas giants, where solid body rotation usually doesn't work. 

Note that Jupiter's core, its equator, and its poles all rotate at different speeds, and so three different rotational systems are used. The standard for measuring System III rotation (the deep interior) is to watch the magnetic field.

This only works, though, if the magnetic poles are tilted to the rotational pole, so that way there's a bit of wobble to the field that we can measure. In the unusual case of Saturn, the magnetic poles and rotational poles are perfectly aligned (we don't know why), and so there is no wobble and this method doesn't work; instead, we rely on [other methods](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Natur.460..608R/abstract).

While the very edge of the GRS does have a ring of very fast winds, the vast majority of it is calm. You never really see precipitation or lightning within the Great Red Spot, they tend to be reserved for chaotic, turbulent cyclonic regions.

Not sure where you're getting that info from. Jupiter's interior is far too hot to allow solid hydrogen.

Current theory is that Jupiter has a liquid metallic hydrogen *mantle* - in fact, by mass, Jupiter is mostly metallic. Inside that mantle is a solid core made of rock and exotic ices, though even more recent Juno evidence suggests it's partially dissolved in the surrounding liquid metal mantle.

I bet you could render a dynamic hydrosphere like that if you fed this height and sea level data into like World Machine or something and added erosion passes.

"It's true, terraforming it in its current state would be much harder than most people realise. Best bet would probably be to crash volatile rich comets/asteroids into it and combine that with the currently frozen Co2 and any sort of artificial gas release we can do to get the right composition.

I guess the original train of this post, though, was more about how it would be if it had a different start, rather than starting from now.

The one major thing it would have needed to stay habitable would simply be **more mass.**

The low mass means lower gravity, so it's harder to hold onto lighter elements (H going to space), and it has less resources to put into the atmosphere, AND its core froze/solidified faster as it was smaller and had less pressure on it, thus no more magnetosphere to stop the solar win stripping away the atmosphere.",0

"The other thing the magnetic field is good for is radiation shielding.

Currently, the surface gets an unhealthy amount of UV, gamma, and x-ray radiation from the sun. We'd need an ozone layer to filter that out, and a magnetic field to protect the ozone from depletion due to solar wind.

"That's not even the issue, really. Almost the entirety of greenhouse emissions is based on organic material. More precisely, carbon-hydrogen chains. Those are usually created by living creatures being buried under certain conditions, which then slowly turn into oils, which can be refined and thus seperated for various uses. Another source is living animals putting out methane. Obviously, coal is another source, though the common use brown coal is created in a similar process as oil.

None of that is, in a way known to us, widely present on mars. And there is no way to realistically supply mars with it to a point that it heats up to earth-like temperature, solely based on earth's ressources. We need them for ourselves.

There are a billion reasons why mars is uninhabitable, and this only scrapes the surface. Mars is extremely low in mass, it cannot hold a magnetic field and much less an atmosphere. Heating it up is virtually impossible.",0
Would the surface temperature of mars be similar to earth?,0
"To my knowledge, falling in the ocean will not cause the reactor to initiate nuclear fission.  The HEU reactor core of a nuclear thermal rocket is built with an integral graphite moderator and control cylinders to turn the reactor on and off.  The only way to initiate fission is to rotate the control cylinders 180 degrees to hide the neutron-absorbing side and expose the neutron-reflecting side.

Already Congress is taking steps to fast-track launch approval for nuclear fission space systems, and NASA has a working prototype of a 1 kWe nuclear fission reactor called ""Kilopower"" which it intends to use on space probes and Lunar and Moon bases.",0

"The way NASA functions is an unfortunate effect of it being a government agency that is not highly regarded by the general public. The fraction of the population who would defund NASA is significant. So in that climate, failure is intolerable. So sometimes they are forced into bad trades to get things done and advance science and technology. Maybe shoehorning SEP on already funded missing was one way to get the technology going. 

As a comparison, SpaceX's first three Falcon rockets failed. No NASA program that fails 3 times in a row would survive today. Back in the Apollo era they had a blank check and could take failures, but a lot has changed since then. So I wouldn't really blame SEP as the thing that prevented NTP from succeeding, but more the nature of NASA and the way they have to function.",0

"Ok, but if an object starts out 13.8 billion light years away, then accelerates away from me at c (light speed), the photons emanating from that object will still only be traveling toward me at c.

Every second I would be able to observe that object as one light second farther away, but in order for me to observe those photons from farther away than the distance light could have traveled since the beginning of the universe, those photons would have to be traveling FTL. 
If the object is accelerating away from me at a fraction of c, it's photons will still be traveling at c, meaning it would take them absolutely 27.6 billion years (or whatever) to reach me. If photons from that object reach me in only 13.8 billion years, either they were traveling at 2c, or there is some massive variable we are missing that is deeply warping our ability to measure distant objects by the photons they are emanating.

"&gt;I think nuclear propulsion increases the takeoff risks very much.


It's easy to see why you would think that, but actually, no, it's quite safe to launch nuclear thermal rockets.


When a nuclear thermal rocket is first built and launched, the reactor core contains nearly pure Uranium 235, which emits relatively safe alpha particles and is only mildly radioactive.  The radiation hazard it poses is similar to that of the Plutonium 238 at the core of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG) which NASA has been launching for 50 years.


It is only once the nuclear thermal rocket is safely delivered to orbit and system checks are performed that it is activated.  Once activated, the nuclear fission reaction begins and the core of Uranium begins to create the dangerous, highly-radioactive fission products that must be contained.  Fortunately, when the reactor is activated, that means the rocket is burning and accelerating away from Earth into Solar Orbit where it is safe.",0

You're off by four orders of magnitude. Mars atmospheric pressure is between 0.0064 and 0.011 bar, so between [0.6% and 1%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28Mars+atmospheric+pressure%29%2F%28Earth+atmospheric+pressure%29+*+100) of Earths atmosphere.

"Alright, I do agree with you, I did word that in a elitist kind of way.

What I should've said is that *I think it's better* to take smaller steps and start experimenting once you're confident enough in your skills and knowledge of basic rules (fundamentals) regarding art. If you start experimenting right away you might miss some important steps along the way and/or continue to reinforce some bad habits. Then when someone points them out you'll always go on the defensive claiming ""that's just my style"".

Also helpful constructive criticism is very hard to come by. Personally I wish I would receive much more of it instead of another ""wow this looks great"".

"I'm going to copy paste my old comment, should give you a good explanation. Some info will be somehwat different with this exact image, but should generally be correct. 


So each camera has an eye (the sensor). The longer the expsosure the more light. However, you also get some blurring effect with moving objects. [Example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQl9T8RCwmfwal-VDV6-yVwBJfZMutGq2oA5d2T0RPpkMkF1Mdf) . Long expsosures are good as it gathers more light and these galaixes are very faint in the sky, so you want to capture as much as possible. There is a catch though, the sky moves. If you just took a long expsosure of the night sky it would blur as the stars move. 



To combat this, you use a star tracker. These rotate the camera in the opposite direction as the earth spins, so it cancels out the movement. This keeps the image still, so you can take long expsosures. With one, you can do expsosures up to 10minutes where as without one you can only do a few seconds. In this case, OP used 30second expsoures. 



However, in the title OP said many hours of data. This is where stacking is involved. If you take a bunch of small photos, and stack each one on top you can improve the image. Every photo has this thing called noise, and thats this [weird grainy effect.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQdo_dsYT8LNGrFb3aOjKs56m64lvD1Pm8vxDRqu20G7wCoXDpL) Also high altitude winds can make images look blurry. 


To combat this you 'stack' the images. Since the distortions and noise is completely random, you can essentially find the 'true' value of a pixel by finding average of it.  However to find an average you need lots of data, which is why you take lots of photos. For an example to find the average age of a classroom you don't take 2 pupils dates, but maybe 15. Same thing. 


Once you have stacked it, you then have an image which is a lot 'cleaner'. Then you use Photoshop to bring out the colours.

"I'm going to copy paste my old comment, should give you a good explanation. Some info will be somehwat different with this exact image, but should generally be correct. 


So each camera has an eye (the sensor). The longer the expsosure the more light. However, you also get some blurring effect with moving objects. [Example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQl9T8RCwmfwal-VDV6-yVwBJfZMutGq2oA5d2T0RPpkMkF1Mdf) . Long expsosures are good as it gathers more light and these galaixes are very faint in the sky, so you want to capture as much as possible. There is a catch though, the sky moves. If you just took a long expsosure of the night sky it would blur as the stars move.

"In this a case of NASA taking a strategic longer term view? Yes SEP might not be an ideal fit for all the missions it has been shoehorned on to, but by getting it to maturity quicker it opens up new missions that SEP facilitates sooner.

I redid some calculations and came to a result of \~77000 W/m² for a 10 second 1 ""foe"" supernova of 600 ly distance.

Pretty serious still.

But I think the energy released by a supernova does not get released evenly within a sphere. Probably more around the equator and less at the poles? Also if 99% of the energy release is in form of neutrinos this would do much less harm than if it were visible light, UV or other higher energy radiation.

And finally didn't supernova last for days? At least a lot longer than a few seconds. That would spread out the energy received much further.",0

NASA tried to ruin the carefully planned New Horizons mission by threatening cancellation if Alan Stern's team didn't redesign to accommodate JPL's SEP stage.  NASA ruined President Obama's interplanetary asteroid mission by turning it into a boulder mission in Lunar Orbit, all so it could test SEP.  Most recently, NASA has been pushing an unneeded lunar space station into plans to return humans to the Moon, all for the sake of an SEP test.  In the essay I state that it is so, and the citations confirm it.


Perhaps I could have made the point more clearly if I had included more direct quotations from my sources, but that would have made the essay even longer.  Therefore, I limited myself to a summary with citations.",0

"first of all - mars tend to lose atmosphere.
50mil years, and oxygen will run away.
But, for us this is more than enough. anyway, aren't we willing to leave Mars self sustainable? 
so we need to make it heavier - drop on it majority of satellites around other planets in our system. also dwarf planets. for example - Io, Ganymede, Europe (if it isn't alive), Titan, Ceres... and maybe some more?.
it's going to reach at least 0.7 Earth's mass, which should be sufficient.
but this type of technologies are far away from us.
also it requires agronomical precision, to not cause harm to solar system as whole.

outcome will be tundra like environment, arctic at poles, and taiga closer to equator.
but, if luck is on our side, and warm water from equator passes through both poles and back to equator, it is going to be noticeable warmer, and maybe even at warmest places, look like Virginia during cold summer.",0
"Terraforming Venus is actually easier than Mars, all things considering, mostly because Mars needs about 40% **more** atmosphere than Earth does to make up for the gravity difference.  Meanwhile, all Venus needs is mirrors to redirect heat so you get the temperature right while you siphon some of its atmosphere *away* to get the right proportions.

People like to assume terraforming is some simple thing that can be done in a couple hundred years.  If you took the largest cargo hauler human beings have ever built, multiplied its size by ten, and sent 100 to arrive at Mars every single day carrying the things needed for terraforming, you could do it without much trouble. 

It would just take you 50,000 years.  I did a thesis project on it once.",0

"Probably not to put into comparison it's current height is roughly 72,000 feet . Earth and mars are almost identical in size with mars being slightly smaller.

If i did things right, in order to adjust the orbit of mars to be within a comfortable habitable zone of about 1.05 au we would need to produce about 72 Octilion Megajoules of energy. Or about 450 trillion Rocketdyne F-1 with 180 second burn time, using 189 quintilion kg of fuel and producing at carbon dioxide and water vapor atmosphere 900x thicker than earths. The released heat would raise the planets temperature to a balmy 7400°C

We could also use project orion, and detonate 10 quadrillion tsar bombas.

Easy enough. Build a giant metal tube and have it stick out of Jupiter. Start a fire at both ends with intake in the middle. Jupiter provides and is your fuel source. The fire on the top is your thrust. The fire below keeps your engine tube from crashing into Jupiter. Have small thrusters on the sides to relocate the tube across the surface of Jupiter.

"**Airy-0**

Airy-0 is a crater on Mars whose location defined the position of the prime meridian of that planet. It is about 0.5 kilometres (0.31 mi) across and lies within the larger crater Airy in the region Sinus Meridiani. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements has now recommended setting the longitude of the Viking 1 lander (47°.95137 west) as the standard.  This deﬁnition maintains the position of the center of Airy-0 at 0° longitude, within the tolerance of current cartographic uncertainties.Merton Davies tied this crater into an extensive geodetic control network of the planet Mars based on Mariner 9 and earlier photographs.

Handily enough, Mars already has a Prime Meridian. It is defined by t[he location of the Viking 1 lander in the center of the Airy-0 crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy-0).

"A thought experiment that keeps me up at night.
  
Say we invent instant teleportation, there would be major downsides when reaching our destination due to velocity and how everything in the universe is moving.  
   
scenario one: The best case, your velocity at point A will match velocity at point B because Point B's device will translate your velocity upon teleportation. Thank god because shit will get nasty and dangerous due to relative velocities.
  
Scenario two: Your velocity at point A will remain unchanged when you teleport to point B. Meaning since earth is moving at 460 meters a second, when you exit on say Jupiter, everything on the planet is coming at you at 11,944 meters per second!  That's like getting on the freeway going 10 miles an hour while everyone is flying past you at 80mph. A cool ass graphic showing the two rotational speeds. https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3609
  
Then there's scenario 3, the worst case scenario. Say teleportation sets your velocity to 0, a pure universal 0 velocity. Because all speed is relative, and frankly earth is a very fast moving train that we are all riding. Imagine jumping off that train and onto the dirt!  Not only is earth rotating at 0.5km a second, its also going around the sun 29km a second. So Jumping from point a, to point b just here on earth would hit you with a 67,000mph speed difference if your universal velocity was reset to zero. 
  
Or in similar fashion, you trying to jump onto a train coming at you 67,000 mph. Since one way of looking at teleportation would be like jumping from a stationary platform onto a moving train, or as in scenario 2, jumping from a moving car onto a moving train.
  
the universe is awesome because here we are. moving through space at 67,000mph and yet we feel as we are standing still.",0

"By that measure, would the planet be better off without a particular species of cyanobacteria, etc?  There are species that exist that have a far greater effect on this planet than we do.  You say that they have the right to exist, or that they have a purpose or a place in this world, but then again, so do we.

If you want to talk about what ""Mother Nature"" wants, then perhaps she -wants- us to cut down trees and create clearings.  Trees cut out light, shut out other species, and can create barren spaces where nothing else can grow. IE, ""Pine Barrens"". Having an unending, unbroken world forest is and would be B.A.D. for most other plants and animals.

Deer and other species flourish when they have open spaces - not necessarily grassy plains, but clearings. Saplings, shrubs, and other low growth are more easily consumed and nutritious than trying to gnaw on tree bark.  They love the edges of crop fields where ""stuff"" is starting to grow in.

Perhaps Mother Nature -created- us as another means of keeping forests constrained, in addition to lightning.  We can keep things thinned out regardless, unlike lightning where the environment has to be tinder-dry for it to work.  No other species can do that, and it's beneficial for many species that we do that.  Think of us as a complement to Beaver. The dammed areas they create turn into meadows - perfect for other wildlife.  We cut down overgrown forests - that then turn into meadows.

In addition, when/if we manage to move off of this planet, we will be taking the biosphere with us - to (re)create worlds that would otherwise never have life.  What other species can do that?  Once again, perhaps we were created by Mother Nature with that mission.  To carry plants and animals with us to other worlds. IE, we're the tool of her will, her bearers, carrying Her to other worlds.

"There's another side to this I think. SEP can provide significantly reduce the propellant mass required for mission, or more usefully allow more total deltaV so longer missions. This is well known and used to great effect on some missions which would not have been possible otherwise. The problem is SEP requires a very different mission trajectory design. So you kind of have to start with that in mind in the concept stages. But, NASA's use of risk and heritage metrics in mission selection makes it hard for newer technology like SEP to get on missions. No one wants to propose a mission that uses SEP if it carries with it a high risk metric since it may not get funded. So sometimes you have to force it if you want a new technology to become tested and used. But if it gets enough heritage, then it becomes a more attractive option risk wise. NTP will suffer the same problems the first few times people try to plan a mission with it, unless NASA ignores the risk. 

That said, SEP is kind of the standard these days for commerical satellites. There's like 300 SEP thrusters in orbit right now. So the technology is pretty mature, but just not in NASA's books for exploration missions. And honestly, even NTP is a pet project. There's lots of models that show it could work, but the practical questions of how do you store cryo hydrogen in space for 3 months, radiation shielding, cooling, structural stresses since NTP ships are really long, and other aspects are still open questions that need to be addressed before any NTP is ever launched.

With 2.5g surface gravity crushing you I'd doubt you'd be able to appreciate whether or not the extra 0.2g makes a difference,0
I'm enjoying the research coming out that is proving terraforming mars to be an impossible task. For now. It is impossible because we have not yet evolved enough to learn and understand new equations and physics to begin the transition towards even higher learning. The amount of attention a project like that would need the entire planet working together all at once for probably decades. This is something I look forward too even more than the concept that will be chased.,0
"&gt;So again, why does everyone seem to acknowledge if Betelgeuse goes supernova it being dimmer then the moon

Because that's what astronomers are saying? Well, they're saying it's going to be as bright as the moon. Also, here's [an article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-betelgeuse-supernova_b_6583546) on some of the effects of Betelguese supernova on Earth. A paragraph on neutrinos specifically:

&gt;SN 1987A produced a neutrino pulse of 10^58 neutrinos, which was reduced to only 24 detected on Earth due to the inverse-square law at the distance to SN1987A, and the fact that neutrinos interact very weekly with our detector matter. If we were to move this to Betelgeuse, we would get a pulse of 24(168,000/590)^2 = 2 million detected neutrinos! This is **utterly harmless** to humans, but will alert astronomers that Betelgeuse is about to blow.

The other issue is that energy in the form of incident neutrinos, and visible range photons, behave very differently.

"No. that is not what Mars would look like under those conditions. Mars has 1/3 Earth gravity, and cannot hold nitrogen and oxygen in an atmosphere. They are too light and will escape its gravity.

So even if it could hold an Earth-like atmosphere, due to low gravity, it would be so thin that nothing could live there. 

Any people on Mars would have to treat life there the way astronauts live in the international space station. They would be unable to sustain a healthy life in low gravity, and would deteriorate over time.

I  don't fully understand your calculations and I'm just jumping into this  but I think I understand why the earth won't be burnt to a crisp.

I  don't see how your calculations take account of the energy density. If  Betelgeuse has indeed gone supernova it's gonna throw it's radiation in  all directions, so if you imagine a 600 light year radius sphere (which  is fun in its own right) the earth is only going to be exposed to a tiny  fraction of that, most of the energy is gonna miss us as it's spread  out across that entire giant sphere.

So it's not just the distance we are from the source , it's also the proportion of that energy we are actually exposed to.

I read in one article that we can each expect less radiation exposure from such an event than we would from eating a banana.""

It takes it fully into account.

The amount the Earth receives as **solar** energy from the sun **1379 W per square meter**

This equates to this formula:   ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (1.5 \* 10\^11 m)\^2) = 1379 W per square meter.

If you move Earth to say Mercury orbit around the sun. And assuming Mercury was furthest from the sun.

69 million km. =  6.9 × 10\^10 so the formula now is: ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (6.9 × 10\^10 m)\^2) = 6519 W/m\^2 =  6519 W per square meter.  6519/1379=4.73x

If Earth was at Mercury orbit at furthest point, it would receive 4.73x as much per square meter.

Similarly, if you move Earth further way, say to Neptune.  4.47 × 10\^12 - ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (4.47\* 10\^12 m)\^2) = **1.553 W per square meter. Which correlates excatly to this:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight)

Table: [https://i.imgur.com/asmUVUi.png](https://i.imgur.com/asmUVUi.png)

You'll notice that the math fits exactly within the range. It applies further away or closer. And in a sphere. It drops exponentially, and goes up exponentially if you are closer. As neptune receives a measly 1.553 W per square meter.

Same factor for the supernova in year 1006. Its 7200 Light years, and thus is exponentially less vis-a-vis in comparison to betelgeuse of 600 light years.

((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (1.49\* 10\^12 m)\^2)

Take a look between Saturn and Earth. Saturn is  1.4979 billion km from the sun, and earth is  147.29 million km. You can see about a 10x difference in distance.. But the solar radiation is  13.9 W per square meter.

So one is thinking, oh betelguese is only 10-12 times closer then the event in the year 1006. Okay, but Earth is only 10 times closer to the sun then Saturn. And the difference is rather massive.",0

For those reasons a satellite or even several are not likely to ruin any shot of a planet.

Even for Deep Sky I think the negatives on the amateur side are somewhat overblown. For professional observatories, yes it is definitely an issue since the satellites will introduce more ""noise"" in the search for exoplanets and such. For amateur imagers as long as you take enough frames pixel rejection can sort out any interlopers (not that it is helping those who live near more cloud-prone skies)",0

I've read articles based on the discoveries of the amazing Cassini mission that said the rings of Saturn are decaying but also most likely being replinished by the tidal induced geysers from at least one of Saturns moons.  They didn't seem sure if that was enough to maintain the rings or just slow their dissappearance.  It's thought the rings themselves were most likely formed from a previous moon that was ripped apart so the decay scenario of at least the majority of the rings may be most likely.,1

"Assuming you using a Crop sensor, about 300 / [Lens Focal Length] = Maximum exposure in seconds. Before someone says its 500, yeah it can be but it depends on how much you pixel peep and crop sensors effectively treat lenses with slightly longer focal lengths. If you are using a typical 300-400mm refractor then this will barely be a second of exposure before trailing becomes an issue so you are unlikely to have much success. Many start at wider focal lengths, ie &lt;20mm since widefield is the most forgiving.

For ISO, depends on the camera. You should find your [ideal ISO](http://dslr-astrophotography.com/iso-values-canon-cameras/) which will allow you the maximum dynamic range. For most cameras this is 800 or 1600. There is little reason to go beyond 3200 in most models since, for values above that, the camera is simply taking a lower ISO image and applying a stretch to both the signal and the noise (which you will often do as part of post processing anyway, so you gain nothing).

To mount the camera, find a [T-Ring](https://www.highpointscientific.com/telescope-accessories/astro-photography/camera-adapters/celestron-canon-eos-t-ring-for-35mm-slr-cameras-93419) wihch fits your camera model (the linked product is for Canon). This will clip onto your camera much like a lens. A [T-Adapter](https://www.highpointscientific.com/telescope-accessories/astro-photography/camera-adapters/celestron-t-adapter-universal-93625) such as this Celestron model will then threat into the ring and allow your camera to insert into the telescope like a standard eyepiece. Depending on the refractor you have, it may have a 2"" diameter so you would then find a 2"" adapter.",1

TIL the Milky Way is giant bear or ewok like thing flying above us (or standing looking down at us I suppose).,1
edit: deleted a double post,1
"Sure thing!  I'm glad to help.

My work involves looking for a type of evolved star called an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.  These things exist as an evolutionary phase of a star after several preceding stages.  The first of which is the main sequence (MS), during which hydrogen is converted into helium in the star's core via nuclear fusion processes.

Then after that there's the red giant branch (RGB) phase, during which the hydrogen to helium fusion takes place within a shell which surrounds the star's core, which is now nothing but the inert helium produced by the fusion of the MS phase.

Than after **that** there's the horizontal branch (HB) phase, when that inert helium core is subjected to enough heat and pressure (from all the nuclear fusion processes surrounding it) that it begins fusion itself, converting the helium into carbon, all while the shell of hydrogen to helium fusion continues around it.

AGB stars are next in the star's evolution, and happen as the helium-fusing core is exhausted, leaving inert carbon (and some oxygen), while helium to carbon continues in a shell around that, and hydrogen to helium fusion continues in a shell around *that*.

Basically, in the AGB star phase, the stellar structure becomes somewhat less stable and massive convection cells begin to dredge up the enriched products of the fusion events (mostly carbon and oxygen) from the star's core, bringing it to near the surface.  This is actually how the Universe produces the majority of its carbon and oxygen, both of which turn out to be pretty important for things like life on Earth.

Since the Spitzer Space Telescope is sensitive to infrared light, and since AGB stars emit predominantly infrared light, it's the best tool we have for finding AGB stars, particularly in external galaxies (i.e., *not* the Milky Way).

My project has been, succinctly, finding AGB stars in a nearby dwarf galaxy called NGC 6822.  This galaxy is interesting in part because its overall heavy-element enrichment (chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium on a periodic table) is quite low, which makes it a convenient accessible analog to the kinds of star-forming galaxies that populated the Universe many billions of years ago.  I want to understand better how AGB stars produce enriched elements like carbon and oxygen in early-Universe-like conditions.

As for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it's going to be an amazing machine.  It's also infrared-sensitive (like Spitzer), but will have a different mission profile.  In short, it and Spitzer will have a lot of overlap in terms of capabilities, but it won't be a direct successor.

For example, Spitzer is a relatively small spacecraft (the primary mirror is only 0.85 meters across), and so is fairly nimble.  This enabled it to survey large areas of space, but not to great depth.  James Webb has a primary mirror that's **huge** by comparison (6.5 meters), meaning it acquire images that are way deeper (and by ""deep"" I mean that it can detect fainter things).  But the trade off is that the spacecraft is the size of a tennis court, and so steering it will be like a boat by comparison.  This means that large-scale surveys are harder to do.

JWST will be amazing at getting detailed studies of faint and distant objects, while Spitzer was fantastic at getting large-scale pictures of relatively nearby objects.

Hope this helps!

This is a tracked/untracked combined pano. All shots were taken in rotational sequence facing the same direction so as to make for an accurate landscape. In other words, this shot would be possible in a single shot with a wider focal length lens, it would just be far less detailed and colorful. No crazy compositing or swapping the sky for a Milky Way facing a completely different direction here.

I used my h-alpha modified Nikon Z6 and Sigma 50mm f/1.4 to take this. I took the tracked shots for the stars at f/2.8, ISO 800, and 2 minutes each with a 50% overlap from one image to the next. After the tracked shot sequence finished, I took the foreground sequence to capture the detail on the landscape at f/1.6, ISO 800, 4 minutes each with the camera still on the tracker and pano head but not actually tracking.

I did initial adjustments in LR on each image, then sent the star and foreground panels in PTGui where they were stitched into each pano mosaic respectively. I exported the foreground mosaic into PS and the star mosaic into Pixinsight. From there, I performed adjustments to reduce the noise, color collaborate (kind of), reduce larger stars, as well as bring out more data in the Milky Way Core. After this, I brought the output file into PS where I stitched it together with the foreground untracked mosaic manually. I used masking to correct for a stitching discrepancy between the layers while performing additional adjustments to my liking to yield this final result.

I wonder what it sounds like there,1
"I hear ya, and I agree after looking at it again. I’ve made some adjustments to the background of what I’ll consider my final image for now.",1
"Here's a fun, and quite likely an apocryphal story.  


When they finished the ceiling, it was soon realized that the night sky was reversed. The lead architect was furious. They had put so much time money and effort into this masterpiece of a train station, just to have a stupid careless mistake ruin it's perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

The architect went to the artist of the ceiling and demanded to know how he could mess up so terribly, and demanded he pay for the cost of redoing it himself.  


The artist, who was quick on his feet, came up with a quick excuse and replied: ""Why, it's not a mistake at all. I wanted to depict the night sky as God would see it when looking down at Earth from Heaven!"". The architect was delighted to hear that, and proceeded to thank the artist for his brilliant take on the night sky.",1
"Nice, but was there a reason for making the background so dark? I think it would’ve looked a bit more natural if the background was more of a greyish colour, especially considering the amount of faint detail you captured which makes the transition rather unnatural.",1
The exos 2 mount I use Sora indeed track if that’s what you mean.,1
Night Cap camera app for iPhone does it for me.,1
"Thank you for taking the time to make this informative write-up. I hope you don't mind answering some questions I have.

Could you share how the data from this scope is used in your work?

And would you happen to know if the James Webb telescope will be a suitable replacement for this scope that we will be losing?",1
It's amazing something that far away could be seen.,1

"The weather was half way decent last night for the first time in a while, so I spent some time out back photographing the Orion Nebula.

This is a challenging shot for me because almost the whole southern part of my yard is covered in trees, so Orion doesn’t come in to view until around 9 pm.

This image is what I was able to get out of about an hour long session.",1
That’s a great photo. It only occurred to me recently why we only see phases on the inner planets.,1
"Most of the gasses are Hydrogen Alpha, and Sulphur .... all within the red spectrum.

Not all nebulas are like this, but there are SOOOo many more of them like this.  Its the most common type.",1
Can’t wait to see Uranus!,1
imagine how satisfying it would be to type in the new coordinates on there system and hit enter,1
Venus should be in red color right.,1
Near sunset these low altitude satillites become visible by reflecting sunlight.  Later in the evening the low angle sunlight won't reach them as the low altitude keeps them in shadow.,1
Most def.,1
I didn’t even need to click to know the answer would be Starlink.,1
Aliens,1
Starlink. Its still Starlink. Its gonna keep being Starlink.,1
"It has reached the end of its operational lifespan, that's all.  Spitzer is an infrared-sensitive telescope, which means it has required significant cooling in order to operate properly (any extraneous heat interferes with the infrared light gathering).

A while back, the coolant on board ran out, as there was only a finite supply when it was launched.  This meant that the longest-wavelength infrared light was now no longer accessible, however it was still able to detect shorter-wavelength infrared light, so it's been operating in a ""warm"" mode ever since (a reduced overall utility, but still something at least).

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits around the Earth like the Space Shuttle, Spitzer orbits the Sun in an Earth-trailing orbit.  This allowed it to more easily remain cold, which is necessary for infrared imaging, but has the side effect of being impossible to go out and service it, like we've done with Hubble a few times.

Furthermore, its distance from Earth has been steadily increasing since it was launched, and maintaining a communication link to it as it gets closer to disappearing under the horizon (of the Sun, from the Earth's perspective) while still angling its solar panels to power the telescope has become increasingly difficult.

So bring all these factors together and the conclusion is that it's time to retire the spacecraft.  Turns out, most space-based observatories don't actually last that long.  Spitzer has been doing its job very well for a very long time.

"How awesome, I just love space's beauty. Nice job",1
"Thank you, Spitzer!",1
Hogwarts staircase right there.,1
It's so freaking beautiful though!,1
Just looking at Venus it gives of mysterious Eerie vibes.,1
" ED 102 scope w/0.7 FR/FF, with QHY 183M

4 hours of HA, 2 hours of Oiii, and 2 hours of Sii. 30 darks, 30 flats, all 5 min subs.

Stacked in DSS, and processed as if it was the SHO pallet, so the outcome is kinda... weird? Love it? hate it? Astrophotography is an art... so I do like it better then the HOO version I tried. It was just so much RED. The HA was prominent as well as the Sii, but the Oiii was almost invisible, so I just thought I would try and get red and blue. Then I just goofed around with the selective color function preset that i use for SHO pallet and kept tweaking it and I got this.

Standard Curves and Level stretching... median filter and that is just about it. I can still see a faint shadow of my amp glow noise, having some trouble calibrating it out in the middle right of the screen, so I have to figure that out.",1
Very nice,1
"Well this particular lecture only really goes on facts, He specifies what he believes is probable and what is not. Yes his ideas maybe wrong but the principals he is teaching in this particular lecture are not.",1
I haven't seen this talk. But take Tyson with a grain of salt. He gets a lot of stuff wrong.,1
"&gt; But I feel like I cant get mad at it because whatever he may be explaining, hes gonna be somewhat correct about it.

A lot of his stuff is wrong. A couple of examples: [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/5vnnym/neil_degrasse_tyson_theres_more_transcendental/) and [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/bfcubz/neil_degrasse_tyson_botches_basic_physics/)",1

Why are they?,1
Does this work in all northern hemisphere? I'm from the UK and would love to use this! Do you habe a link to the spreadsheet?,1
Why will the telescope be powered off? Were there technical malfunctions recently? If not then it's a shame to shut it down before it's broken.,1
I can barely get Jupiter in focus and you managed to see the sun through the atmosphere. Amazing!,1

"Wow, nice!

I had a look through my 8"" dobson the other day, and it was very blurry and hazy, I guess since it was still close to sunset and Venus was low in the horizon. I could just barely make out the crescent disc shape.

Really nice shot. The inferior planets are fascinating in their own way.",1
Outstanding photo,1
Almost looks like a cobra in the middle. Great picture!,1
"I guess it's not a very popular target since you don't get to see visible features without a UV filter. Also, even though it's visible and close, it's still pretty close to the horizon so it's tricky to image.",1
"I took this in October when I was in a much less light polluted area than I normally image in.

A giant middle finger,1
"Finally, someone took a picture of venus. I Dont understand why nobody is taking pictures now it is visible and close.",1
"One of the best amateur pictures of Venus I've seen, if not the best.",1
"I can only see a white patch around the nebulas core and some hints at the rest.
However after just 10 seconds of exposure even with a smartphone I can see both colors and a lot of the structure.",1
That’s awesome to hear :),1
"Awesome picture. It’s amazing looking upon Venus, and realizing that underneath that soft, pale green atmosphere is a nightmarish hellscape!",1
really cool!,1
lol,1
"Good, it's still there. Thanks for checking in on that for us. 

But really, cool shot.",1
When I was right I got to take a tour there at night. That made my love for astronomy so much greater.,1
"I guess we both are

Thanks for that. Love seeing any array ! Guess I’m just weird.,1
Nicely done!  Thanks for sharing.,1
Every star we can see in the sky with the naked eye is within a small portion of our own galaxy and isn't very far away. There would be no significant difference.,1

"The “contradiction” you mention is a known problem, and the main reason why there is not a “Grand Unified Theory” yet. Quantum mechanics describes the incredibly small part of the universe (interactions of molecules and atoms) whereas relativity talks about the incredibly large (interaction of stars, planets, black holes, etc).

The contradiction comes from how differently the two fields describe the universe. Relativity says the fabric is space-time is flat and uniform, while quantum says it’s rough and chaotic. An example is when you study a black hole. Using relativity gives you one answer, and using quantum gives you another. They don’t match each other, but they are both correct. The discrepancy seen here is the reason why there appears to be a contradiction, and it’s also why the study of String Theory has gained popularity (it’s the most correct idea we have as of right now).

It’s been a while since I last studied either so I’m probably missing a few things here and there, but this is the main idea I remember from school.",1
"Wow, this is incredible.",1
Agreed!,1
"You know, I understand what you mean by pompous. I can see it when he explains certain things on his podcast (Star Talk).

Idk of Netflix is the same in all countries. 

Atm though I’m still trying to fathom a certain section in this lecture.
It’s driving me mad, I’ve been reading and researching for hours on end. 
He talks about a contradiction between quantum physics and relativity. 

He explains the expansion of the universe well, easier to understand than the balloon example lol

Now his idea about a parallel universe is maybe for theatre but I’m so deeply confused.",1
"You'll start to see it after a while. I'm still a huge fan (got to see him live!), but you'll notice he can come off a little pompous at times.

Anyways, if you have Netflix, I highly recommend ""Cosmos."" Season two was announced recently too!",1
That’s really cool.,1
"&gt;This nebula is definitely lit

you are correct",1
"There's still so much we don't know. People invent ideas like String Theory to explain things they can't explain and then spend decades looking for proof they'll probably never find because their basic premises are flawed to begin with. In the meantime newcomers to science automatically assume the validity of the Electric Universe and some even find themselves swayed by Velikovsky. 

I'm a simple kind of person. I look at what I can see and apply it to what I can't. That tells me the universe is circular in nature just like the galaxies, solar systems and planets. It's up to those who disagree to prove their ideas to me. Not the other way around.",1
"If the light reached us instantly, it would look nearly identical-less the delay that distance/c provides. Every star would look pretty much the same, just what it looks like now vs what it looks like x years ago based on the distance.",1

"“The Unknown Universe Explained” on YouTube

It was 3hrs + long. Fantastic!",1
"Binos, which you can use whenever.",1
Yeah I figured that the worst thing to do was buy a telescope at costco or walmart or etc,1
Didn’t know that . Thanks for the info.,1
"Please don’t. The telescopes you can get at Costco would just turn you away from the hobby because they’re so frustrating to use, and the views would be absolutely terrible.",1
"Yeah that's about what I thought. I can scrape up more money, and I probably will, as I'm greatly interested in getting a better look at things",1
"Your binoculars will be better than any $100 telescope. You’d be better off raising your budget 2x by getting an AWB OneSky, Skywatcher Heritage 130P. Zhumell Z130, or looking in your local classifieds. 

There is the Orion Skyscanner for $100 which does have a parabolic mirror so optically, it’s superior to other scopes in that price range. But at f/4, there’s going to be lots of comatic aberration and loss of contrast because of the larger central obstruction, and the aperture of 100mm is still pretty small.",1
Costco has some greats deals on telescopes . Buy them during sale and you can get something decent for around 130,1
"You can get really good quality eyepieces for the price of a meal at a nice restaurant.

6mm 66° wide angle eyepieces (known as 6mm goldlines) deliver good image quality and are very affordable. They’re not perfect of course, but for their price they’re amazing. Cost between $20 USD to $40 USD, depending where you buy it. Orion sells them under the Orion Expanse name.

Plossl eyepieces are also nice, and are pretty affordable. They have a decent field of view (~50°), but with 1.25” versions (your focuser can’t accept 2” eyepieces), when you reach a certain focal length (I believe 32mm) the FOV starts to decrease as the barrel starts to get in the way. Also avoid plossl eyepieces under 10mm because their eye relief is poor and they’re uncomfortable to use. About $20-$40 USD, so same price as the goldline pretty much.",1
"An 8” dob such as the Apertura AD8 - don’t know if they ship to Hawaii though. In visual astronomy, aperture is king and dobsonian telescopes are the perfect mix of aperture, affordability, and quality. You won’t be able to use it for daytime use, but buying an additional good pair of binoculars will serve as a compliment to the telescope during night (for those ultra wide views of massive objects), and can be used during the day.",1
"Well first off, the Astromaster 114EQ has a really, really, bad mirror. So bad that i's hard to focus on anything at high power and things look a bit blurry, but tolerable at low power. Also the mount shakes like a mofo if you touch it taking quite a bit of time to settle back down.

It's likely the reason why the son just abandoned the telescope at his dad's house in the basement was due out of frustration from the bad optics and mount. One more thing, the 20mm is standard, also comes with a 10mm, but like you said, it was missing it and the scope goes for $190 new online. You saved a whole $40.

The telescope could still be used, but it's best to upgrade as soon as you can. There are far better Telescopes for not much more. Usually people suggest a Dobsonian. A 6"" can go for about $350 but an 8"" for $500 is the best bang for the buck. Huge aperture for the money.

As for eyepieces, you're probably looking at the high end gear. Televue, Explore Scientific, Vixen Optics, ect... They all produce eyepieces for serious, advanced astronomers with fancier scopes.

If you look up ""Orion Sirius Eyepieces"" or ""Celestron Omni Eyepieces"" you will get cheaper, but still decent eyepieces. But seriously, upgrade as soon as possible, or even see if he would refund you. Probably not, but you can try. Practically got ripped off.

Edit:  Come on over to /r/telescopes. They can help you with any more questions you might ask.",1
"The lenses are pretty much universal. You know the telescope is gonna have limitations, so you want to start with some basic lenses; something like [this](https://smile.amazon.com/SVBONY-Telescope-Eyepieces-Accessories-Astronomic/dp/B01LZ6DDC2)  might be a good place to start.

If you do decide to invest in a good eyepiece, let it be your barlow(s). 

I got a telescoping lens that I enjoy since I mostly
look at the moon/jupiter/saturn, so it works for me.",1

"Nice shot. But your description is unfortunately ""bad"". (Or more specifically and gently: incorrect.) Tying events in the cosmos to what was happening here on Earth is illogical, incorrect, and just ties you in mental knots.

I know pop-sci often expresses things this way. But they're wrong for doing so, and should feel bad. ;-)

Real cosmologists don't do this. They speak of things in terms of what we see *right now*. Betelgeuse, for example, ""may go supernovae soon"". Not, ""it probably went supernova a few hundred years ago"".

That's for these reasons (that are really just different ways of saying the same thing):

1. Time and space are fundamentally intertwined. Einstein viewed it as one thing that can't be teased apart.
2. Causality travels no faster than the speed of light. It isn't meaningful to express an ""order of events"", when those events are in different inertial frames, and/or separated by interstellar distances. There's literally no way to prove that something happened to a remote object, in terms of what happened in our past here. (In other words, your claim - while fun - is literally baseless and unfalsifiable. Not even in a pedantic way.)
3. There's no such thing as ""Simultaneity"". Which would be a pedantic thing to say about events on Earth - because in everyday human life, simultaneity is very much a thing, to the limits of our perception - and in fact much of our life is deeply dependent on simultaneity being a reliable thing. (Or at least close enough.) But at interstellar distances, lack of the existence of simultaneity is very much a relevant - even critical - concept.
4. There is no privileged frame of reference.

The direct consequence of this, is that it's utterly meaningless to say ""when"" something happened, that far away, relative to our inertial frame. All we can meaningfully say, is how far it is away from us right now from our perspective (using parallax or other approximate yardsticks), and its apparent vector of motion relative to us - right now from our perspective. And we can only meaningfully talk about ""sequences of events"", in terms how they are observed from our perspective.

For example: For something traveling at the speed of light - say a photon - there is zero time or space in the direction of travel. More specifically, since the rest of the universe is moving at the speed of light relative to the photon, the universe is compressed in the direction of travel. So much, that at light speed, there is no length in the direction of travel at all. The entire universe is reachable instantly, from a photon's perspective.

Clearly, the perspective of a photon leaving Betelgeuse, and you on Earth, don't remotely agree. And there are infinite inertial frames of reference in between, and none of them (not even ours) is privileged. Now you can start to see why it is utterly meaningless to compare an event many light years away, with an event in our own past. (And even worse, to express it with the language of simultaneity.)

Another example: If you were to launch on a spaceship from Earth, and travel at a constant 1 G of acceleration, here is what would happen: From your perspective, the universe would very gradually contract and shift to blue in the direction of travel. You could circumnavigate the entire universe in your own lifetime. But by the time you returned home, there'd be no Earth. No sun. No Milky Way galaxy. No local group. Probably no galaxies at all, anywhere to be seen - and possibly not even any protons left. Knowing this already though (and knowing that even if Earth somehow still existed it would essentially be impossible to find), you might choose to continue rather than doing a 1G flip 'n burn. In which case, you could (seemingly) paradoxically accelerate at 1 G forever, without increasing your rate of fuel consumption, and without ever reaching light speed.

But from Earth's perspective, your ship would start to get shorter, redder, and gain mass. Eventually appearing to be headed towards infinite mass, and seemingly headed towards requiring infinite energy to continue accelerating.

So when someone - or some pop-sci publication - conflates distance in light years, with time in years...they're just flat wrong. You can't separate time from inertial frame of reference. (That is, if Special Relativity is a thing, which by now has an overwhelming body of observational and experimental support.)

As a talented photoastronomer (at minimum), I might hope you'll start popularizing this notion. It's not hard for laypeople to grasp. I've found that young children are particularly adept at understanding it. Maybe they haven't yet been rigidly programmed to expect ""simultaneity"" to exist? Who knows. But adults can ""get it"" too.

Here's another, more technical way of looking at it:

And another, cheesier but simpler way, with soothing music.

"The Rosette Nebula – C49

Captured on the 15th of January, this is the result of just over 1,5 hrs of exposure on this nebula. At a distance of 5.200 lightyears, this is one of the closer star forming regions, and is active with very hot, young stars in its core. The apparent ‘hole’ in the center of the nebula is the result of the young stars’ strong stellar winds, blowing away the nebula’s gases.

"Multiple exposures, each much shorter in length, are added together using computer software.  Each image is aligned so that the objects imaged within are directly on top of each other (really meaning that a common coordinate system has been worked out for all the pixels in all the images) and the photon counts are added, so you get the same numbers you would if you worked for a single 13.79 hour block.",1

Who took a dump on the stars again?,1
"The very basic process is this: take several images of the same object, then load them all into your computer and use some stacking software like Deep Sky Stacker ([http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html)) or non-free equivalents to add the separate images in order to make one that simulates a longer exposure.  This process gets around the fact that no star tracking camera mount is perfect. A lot of people will then process photos in something like Photoshop to improve image quality.   

Minimum requirements are a sturdy, heavy tripod (wind is a hazard to clear long-exposure photographs) and a camera that allows you to control exposure time, ISO, and aperture and set focus to infinity (and have it stay there)

Life is better if you have some kind of star tracker (entry levels include things like these: [https://astrobackyard.com/star-tracker-astrophotography/](https://astrobackyard.com/star-tracker-astrophotography/)) or telescope mount; a lens with a wide aperture; and the ability to save RAW format images (JPG compressors in cameras suck at dealing with stars)

The rest works like regular photography.  Longer lenses mean smaller field of view which means more magnification when you show it on your screen, but are more expensive and require more stability (which here means better tracking) With a wide-field lens you can go without the star tracker and just take a lot of exposures, but this will require a lot of room on your data card.  A telescope is a specialized lens for astrophotography, and it improves things but is not obligatory.  

Stepping up involves using a telescope, specialized astronomy cameras, imaging and image processing software, filters that select colors that you want, etc.  Go search on terms that Chuck used to find out what they mean and what the equipment does.",1

"That's the point of them hence ""Setting"" Circle. The idea for the RA is you set it to your current time. Easy way to set it would be to point the telescope at an obvious, easy to see, easy to identify star. Like Sirius for instance.

 Of course, do this after properly centering your telescope on Polaris first. After that, point to the star you know, and look at the star's coordinates in some kind of astronomy software. 

Note the The RA, then quickly on your scope set the RA Setting circle to read the same number. It is now collimated to your time. The DEC usually is fixed in place since pointing true Celestial North should always be 0\* (360\*). If it's loose for though, same thing. Just turn it untill it's the same  coordinate as the software says.

Just be aware they are not terribly accurate. They will get you within a few degrees of your target. But a few degrees is better than aimlessly wander around.  

As for the constant slipping around, just use some clear tape and hold it in place.",1
Agreed. Any option to add thin lines depicting orbits.,1
"The RA setting circle is supposed to be loose since you're meant to calibrate it. 

Here are a couple videos that demonstrate how to use them:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_TDh68oDp4
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tft-5QJgnto

The problem is that they are rarely accurate enough to put the object in field of view of the eyepiece.

You're honestly better off just learning how to star hop and using a planetarium app like Sky Safari or Stellarium to help guide you.",1

"In my experience (PhD in astronomy, did a few postdocs around the US), there are astro departments that are great if you're a researcher, there are astro departments that are great if you're a student, but there's not a lot of overlap.

Institutions like Caltech, U of Arizona, Harvard, etc. pride themselves on being ""[R1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States)"" research institutions. They receive a disproportionately large share of NASA and NSF funding, there are genuinely some world-famous astronomers there, and they're cranking out tons of papers. That's a great environment if you're in a postdoc position also trying to crank out as many papers as possible...but maybe not so great if you're a grad student just trying to learn the ropes. High-pressure environments like that are probably not the best if you're just starting out.

Slightly less competitive ""R2"" grad school programs tend to be a bit more relaxed and low stress, which for me at least, seems more conducive to learning; I saw a lot more grad students rage quit the entire program from R1 departments than R2 departments. True, you will be somewhat less likely to get in on the ground floor of the very best research projects working with the most famous people...but I also think that's a worthwhile trade if you just want to learn how the universe works.",1

anybody else see the grinch’s face?,1
I know,1
"My friend, my favorite part about this hobby is in fact indulging in the curiosity of others and sharing the beauty our night sky has to hold. Pleased to answer anything I can. I started with a simple dslr + lens on a little tracking motor that counters the earth's rotation allowing you to take long exposures, usually around 60 seconds. This really is all you need to get started in the hobby and is a great way of learning the basic techniques. A motor like the skyguider pro could cost around $500 CAD. I then graduated to a small telescope that I could attach my dslr to. Over time, I got various light pollution filters so I could image from my city backyard, special cameras that could help me more precisely align with the north  celestial pole so I could expose for longer, and a much more sturdier mount. This hobby could cost $500 or $5000 (or more) depending what you want to do with it. The basic process is that you line up your mount or motor with the north celestial pole and it starts rotating with the stars. I set my exposure length on my camera using an intervalometer which controls exposure length and how many images to take. Then I go inside and take it easy until I need to go and change my dslr battery. In the morning all those individual 3-minute long photos are stacked on top of each other to bring out the faintest details in extensive post processing in photoshop, so the 6 hours of filming is combined into a single image. It'sa lot of info in there, usually hundreds of MB's large. As far as walking noise and dithering it may sound like jargon haha. If you zoom in on the dark areas you'll see some streaking, that is walking noise. Dithering is a process where, if you have a capable camera and mount, the camera is shifted a few pixels between each exposure so the noise doesn't get sort of stacked as well so you're left with a cleaner picture. I'll tell you this my friend, I never in a million years imagined I'd be taking these kinds of photos, but it's become such a big part of my life and opened my eyes to what is up there when we look to the skies that I don't lnow where I'd be now without this hobby. If you're ever interested in learning more about it please don't be shy to ask me anything, it is a privilege to share this hobby with anybody interested in it!!",1
"I could be wrong, but I think it has something to do with angular momentum being conserved during planet formation.",1
"I think being able to do this is so cool. Is there any way you would be interested in indulging the curiosity of someone who is not at all familiar with this hobby? About how much does the equipment you use cost? I saw some other comments about ""walking noise"" and ""dithering"" and other really cool/nonsense sounding jargon, what is up with that stuff? What does the process of taking 6 hours worth of images look like in terms of what you are doing? Are you sitting out there, sipping coffee from a thermos cup, clicking photos every few seconds? Or, is it more of a set-it-and-forget-it type situation? 


Feel free to just ignore this. I understand it might be instrusive, or you may just be uninterested in answering questions, and that is totally fine. I really like your picture.",1
Is a legit article and research.,1
The creation of elements is always exciting!,1
Nice. You even got Vito Corleone nebula in the shot.,1
"All articles have a click baity title. It has been the norm for years. Even newspapers before should have a read baityish title. If your title does not stand out, it will not be read or in this generation will not be clicked and read. And when the authors have already established their audience, Even a title like read this will get a lot of traction.",1
"Check the universities you are looking at to see how they accept AP credits.  My university wouldn’t accept the AP in place of the class if you were going to major in that area.  Take AP chem, bio and physics because you plan to be a science major? Nope, we’ll give you those as gened credits.  I ended up taking the same classes, with the same book.   It didn’t save me any time, effort or money.  It did make chem for science majors easier, and the overall adjustment to university easier.  Had I wanted to be a history major or anything non-science, the APs would have fulfilled my science requirements.  I would have been better off taking study hall in high school and the science class at a nearby local college and transferring it.  I hope things have improved.",1

It really is amazing, scary and beautiful.",1
I'd rank them in reverse order. The C course if you can do the math.,1
"its more than twice the distance from earth to the nearest star to us.  humans can't really grasp these kinds of distances.. and thats just the tadpoles themselves.  The rest of the nebula is bigger.

If you were traveling at 186,000 miles per SECOND, non-stop with no rest, for 10 straight years, you would have traveled the length of just those tadpoles.  Going at that speed it would ""only"" take you 4 years to get to the nearest star to us.",1
"Have you done any astro shots before? Of course better gear makes a difference,  but you'd be amazed at what you can get with just a dslr and a little tracking motor like the Skyguider pro. That's how I started and it was great to get a tast of the hobby that way. But of course I love the equipment I have now haha",1
"That's jaw droppingly huge. 10 light years long? 
I know that's perplexing, but what would be a size comparison? Like, 1 million suns or our solar system x 100",1
"each dot, is a star, in our galaxy.   This is a closer look at a gargantuan cloud of dust.  Those tadpoles are actually excited dust that is over 10 light years long, so you can image the size.",1
"Lol true.

Shots like these make me really want to save up at least a few grand to try and get some really good shots like this with my own gear.",1
Zoom in on the middle area. There is a small dark patch shaped like a horse’s head. What’s crazy is the nebula is 3.5 lights years long. Hundreds of suns could fit in that tiny little horse head.,1
"Thank you! 1,500 light years away actually, not too far in the grand scheme of things haha",1
This looks great. How far away is this nebula?,1
"That's the diameter of the telescope aperture! It has a 350mm focal length which gave a good field of view, only cropped about 30% of the final image!",1
"Calculus based. The first physics course you'll take in university will be calculus based, so might as well be familiar with it.",1
"All the bright dots are subs! If you zoom in right aroubd the horses head all the little ones there are brand bew suns being created. Though some may have planets orbiting, I definitely can't see them with the little scope I have haha",1
"Any of them will give you a good base but none will delve into astrophysics as much as you likely want it to.

"Your radius increased so your velocity decreased in order to maintain 1G. 

One hundred percent of the original length is just R.

But you've expanded by 0.2% so two tenths of one percent or R(0.002) so then the final length is R + R(0.002)...  so 1.002R

Are you sure that you're writing the percentage correctly? 50% of R = 0.5R the way you have it written its 2% not 0.2%...

If R increased  by 50% it would be 1.5R or 150% of the original length.

To increase R by 2% youbwould have. 0.02R + R = 1.02R.

0.2% is two tenths of one percent...  so I think you have a translational error in your work somewhere.

"Well, I froze the video at the end of the 2 second mark.  I printed the still image.   Using calipers on the paper printout I measured the length of the chord.  (End to end of the arc) and the height of the arc from the chord.  I used that in a formula to figure the radius of the circle.  I have a known radius for the sun at 432690 miles.  Between the radius measurement I had, and the actual radius of the sun I now had a conversion factor for any inch measurements in the paper to real miles.  I measured the height of the circle the plasma (I think it's plasma) made and the width at the end of the 2 second mark, which was pretty much the largest it got.  I tried to measure the middle of the plasma on one side, to the middle of the other.  I did the same measurement for the width of the circle the plasma made and averaged them.  I now had an average diameter of the plasma circle.  Diameter times pi gives me the circumference.  I'm in agreement that the plasma appears to make 3 revolutions in that two hours.   (although I think it may have made the 3 in the first 80% of the video.)  From there it's just a miles per hour conversion.   clearly a lot of room for error.  


Edit: By the way, the math I believe is solid.  I double checked it.  The error of course is where I measure the diameter from, the fact it is not a perfect circle, the error in measuring the chord length and arc height.   And the biggest margin is how many revolutions  per time.  lots of room for error there.",1

**GASP!!!**,1
"Ah both are used, makes sense.  Thanks!",1
"Wow, really great stuff.  

Obviously, my first step is just figuring out the mount setup and proper operation.  Then move on to trying to image.  Guiding and so on seems like a complex place to start so for now, I don't even understand why the guide scope is needed so better steer clear for now haha.  I'll stick to observing on the SCT/alt-az and  using the EQM/ST-80 to attempt imaging.  

Thanks!",1
"Yes, especially if you are using your SCT since the ASPA process usually slews it well outside the FoV. I also found a 12mm Reticled eyepiece to be helpful for fine tuning the centering",1
"All images were pretty much straight off the camera.  No filters.  Some minor editing (curves and levels) was in photoshop or gimp to brighten the image and set the black point, but for the most part they're single images so no stacking.  All except the moon were taken from a dark site which is crucial to initial success and exposures were all under 2 min at iso 1600.  SCTs are not good beginner AP scopes as the focal length is just too long for most people's mounts.  You need a very good mount to do SCT AP.  Plus, SCTs have very narrow fields of view (which limits your targets to very small objects), crummy focus issues, really bad coma (unless you have a newer Edge or ACF model), and you will need a guider setup (which the st80 would be great for, it's what I use).  But if you have a good mount and are willing to struggle with guiding and all the other issues, you can get decent [results](https://imgur.com/a/RAyCZVH).  [Here](https://imgur.com/dEDvxKF) is my setup I used to take the images through my SCT.  The 2"" extension should be enough.",1
"Follow up Q .... When doing the alignment, is it ok to use a wide FOV eyepiece to set up like a 40mm or do you use something with more magnification to be more accurate?",1
"A two panel wide-field mosaic of the Blue Horsehead Nebula (IC 4592), a faint reflection nebula in the constellation Scorpius. The nebula is lit by the multiple Star System Nu Scorpii. Follow the image link for more info.",1
"Thanks for the info.  I have used the SCT direct mount to shoot the moon which was really cool.  I'll have to take a crack at it with the ST-80 onc eI get the mount sorted too.  I'm newly trying to learn how to set up a CG-5 GoTo so I don't have to manually track for viewing and can do long exposures for imaging.  

I've never quite understood how the color is obtained in AP images I see, I assume a ton of editing for one.  Stacking also seems to be a frequent term that comes up.  I'm just getting started all around so it'll be a long process but I'm excited to dive in and see if I can find my way to taking some nice images.",1
Beautiful area. I used to go out to Palomar quite a bit.,1
"Nah, aperture doesn’t matter in AP. What matters more is the focal ratio, as that is what determines how much light you can collect. Note that the focal reducer adds another piece of glass to the imaging train, so more aberrations such as chromatic or vignetting will be present. 

The ST80 is actually a really nice scope, because it’s fast (f/5) and dirt cheaper Only issue is that it’s an achromatic refractor, so it’s colour correction isn’t that great. When imaging, you’ll notice that the stars will always appear purple, and some brighter objects like planets or the moon will show colour fringing. You’ll want to upgrade eventually as you can’t really fix the colour issue, but it’s great way to get started nevertheless.

If you get into planetary imaging though, use the SCT, as that’s one of their major strengths. SCTs are probably the best kind of telescope to use when imaging planets, and in that kind of AP aperture does matter.",1
"Ah I see.  Shows what I know, I assumed the larger aperture would allow greater light collection and make it better than my refractor for nebula and galaxy viewing/imaging.  

If it makes any difference, the SCT came with the f/6.3 reducer.  However, I mean I would be floored by images of the quality you linked if the ST-80 is capable of that with the right skill behind it.",1
"About how long would it take until this game would come out?

Is there some way you can code in an ever changing environment? For say, stars can stop making reactions and cool off, supernova, yadda yadda. Ever changing I suppose.

Best of luck! This sounds amazing.",1
"I have a ST-80 and a 8"" SCT.

Really, the entire process of setting it up.  Without a manual and only a low level understanding of mounts/scopes, I'm struggling.  The Alt-Az is ok but having to manually track gets frustrating and therefore off-putting to the point I don't even want to go out and mess with it.  The hope is the EQ mount will make it more enjoyable (once I understand how to use it) and less frustrating.  All the while putting me in a position to track and try out imaging once I gain some comfort with it.  

Thanks for the run down, I'll try to stumble through it and look into the all star polar align.  I'm not sure what you mean by index marks though? Is this the 'set to zero' red lines?",1
"SCTs are slow at collecting light (normally f/10), and have tediously long focal lengths. When shooting at f/10, it takes 4x longer to get the same amount of data than when you shoot at f/5. Also, the longer focal length will often cause too large of an image scale (things are zoomed in too much), and also magnifies any errors in tracking, polar alignment, etc.",1
"Assuming you use a small refractor, a CG5-GT is [quite]( https://www.astrobin.com/353496/?image_list_page=2&amp;nc=&amp;nce=) usable for [taking]( https://www.astrobin.com/356053/?image_list_page=2&amp;nc=&amp;nce=) good [astrophotos]( https://www.astrobin.com/340927/?image_list_page=2&amp;nc=&amp;nce=).

 However, I am unsure what specifically you need help with. Polar alignment on equatorial Celestron mounts is largely the same across all models, so any “All Star Polar Align” tutorial would suffice.
The general procedure is to confirm the mount date, time, and that the mount is at index marks. It will then slew to 2 stars, have you center each of them, and then slew to up to 4 more stars for calibration where you do the same thing.

To polar align after this (as ASPA basically just tells you your polar alignment error), have the mount slew to a bright southern equatorial star, back out of all menus on the HC, go to Align &gt; Polar Align &gt; Align Mount and you will again have to re-center the star. The mount will again slew away from the star, but only based on the calculated error. From here you will need to use only the adjustment knobs for altitude/azimuth near the top of the tripod to physically fine-tune the polar alignment.

Running this process twice can confirm a good polar alignment, and you shouldn’t need more than 2 or 3 calibration stars.

"Sorry, it's a CG-5.  I'll keep digging for better tutorials.",1
"Which mount do you have?  The CG-5 and CGEM are very different mounts.  The CG-5 typically is not designed for AP, even if it has goto.  The CGEM is more suited.  CGEM manual can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/celestron-site-support-files/support_files/1235085036_cgem11097inst.pdf) if you didn't get one.  There are plenty of vids and sites to help you get started on using your new mount.  Just google ""how to use an equatorial mount"".",1
"Great pics!  What sort of editing is involved with those? Do you use any filters?

What makes an SCT bad at AP?  Just curious.  

I will def try out the ST-80 too.  I do have the 2"" extension tube, would that work are you mentioned for the focus range?",1
"You're going about it all wrong with what you've got.  Ditch the SCT, it's a horrible AP scope unless you have a very good mount ($$$$).  Use the ST80 instead.  Don't use eyepiece projection or the barlow.  This just narrows your field of view and causes unnecessary aberrations.  Just attach the T ring to the camera, screw on the T adapter and insert into the focuser.  For the ST80, you might need an extension to get the camera to focus as it may not have enough outward travel.  While the ST80 is not the best scope to start with either, lots of CA and SA, it's good enough to get you started.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/nA5c99L) are some images I've taken with my ST80 and 350D just to give you an idea of what you can do.",1

"You could have two Black Holes orbiting each other and then put yourself at the mid-point, so it's not a stupid question (ie it's not an impossible setup). By symmetry alone you would remain stationary there, so I suppose yes spacetime must be flat at that point. Whether ""time is wonky"" though is relative to an observer at infinity - and any geodesic connecting you to a point at infinity must go through regions where spacetime is not flat, so there would certainly be non-zero time-dilation and gravitational redshift. ie you're at a point where spacetime is flat, but that point is at the bottom of a gravitational well.

(Note: this is all very guessworky as this is well outside my region of expertise!)",1
"Beautiful! I did not know:

M82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor, the spiral M81. Tidal forces caused by gravity have deformed M82, a process that started about 100 million years ago. This interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to ""normal"" galaxies.",1

"Shortly after the [James Lick observatory](https://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/36-inch.html), Mt. Hamilton, San Jose, Ca. was built. 36"" refractor. 

&gt;When completed, the Lick Refractor was the largest refracting telescope in the world. Even today, it is second in size only to the 40-inch Yerkes Observatory refractor. 

I don't know the [current status of tours](https://www.ucolick.org/main/visit/walking_tour.shtml), But I have been on ones where you got to see the telescope.",1
Kinda looks like spiderman is chilling on your porch.,1
Is that true? Can we not rewind physics enough to figure out where the stars were?,1
"Long exposures where the camera shutter is left open for long times (30 seconds to several minutes) are used to capture the light of deep space objects, as they’re too dim to be captured using regular photographic techniques. All of the light accumulates onto the sensor so in the end, you capture the photons emitted by the object. What telescope do you have? 

I’d hate to burst your bubble, but chances are you probably don’t have the right equipment to take photos of deep space objects. You need a precise and accurate equatorial mount capable of holding a telescope, such as an Orion Sirius EQ-G or HEQ5 Pro, which retail for about $1000 USD. You’ll also need a DSLR camera or a cooled CCD camera, which can also be expensive. You generally need a budget of a couple thousand dollars to get started in astrophotography.

All is not lost though. Taking photos of the moon and planets can be done easily, with pretty much any telescope. You can even use your phones camera.

I’d suggest visiting r/askastrophotography for more info.",1
"If it’s on Netflix I watched it haha.

Thank you, I will def look it up. I can finally understand new science articles, better.",1
"""The way that deep space astrophotography works is that you have a motorized equatorial mount aligned with how the Earth rotates. The mount is able to track any object in the night sky. Many long exposure images are taken, and combined using a method called image stacking, which significantly improves the quality of the final image.

Most astrophotographers use a monochrome camera because it gives them flexibility in recording the specific type of light they want.

In some pictures, special filters are used that isolate the very specific wavelength of light that gets emitted by various ionized gases. The most common filters are hydrogen, sulphur, and oxygen. Each gas gets mapped to either red, green, or blue. The end result is a false colour picture that has a large amount of contrast.

True colour photos are shot using regular red, green, and blue filters, or by using a normal colour camera.

The images can be taken over one night or several, it doesn't matter. The more total exposure time you have, the better quality the final image will be. This is why people spend tens of hours on a single image, to get a better result. It gets much more in-depth than this, but that's a basic overview of how people do this type of astrophotography (deep space astrophotography).""",1
"Here’s a photo from the 2019 Julian Starfest. Taken with a Fuji XT1 camera and a 12mm Rokinon lens. This was a single 25 second exposure, with some light edits made in PS to bring down the red glow on the house and the girl, and to bring up the saturation a bit on the core of the Milky Way.

" Forming and originally existing at a distance of 7 AU from its two suns/system barycenter, Capella Aab may have very well had once had the right temperatures to possibly sustain liquid H2O on its surface, although the intense solar radiation of the system’s primary, may have been to intense for life to appear. Only hundreds of millions of years into the initial formation of the system, the two suns have expanded from blueish A/B main sequence main stars into yellow giant stars, baking the surface of the planet. However because of its outer orbit, it was spared from being destroyed, but is still a totally inhospitable shorching wastleland.

Orbiting in a dusty disk of debris-like material around 1000 AU from two stars of Eta Carine is a planet that shouldn’t even exist at all. Both stars in Eta Carinae likely started out as blazing hot O-type main sequence stars, whose solar winds should have completely cleared away any additional material after formation and the possibility for planets. In addition, the primary star underwent a supernova-like eruption of gas. However somehow this planet, which is actually more akin to a small planetoid/asteroid, somehow has survived. A similar dusty disk that this planet exists in, has been found around the blue hypergiant star, HD 37974.",1

Further, the refurbishments for the telescope run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.

"Their endowment pays for operating costs of the school which is significant, as Harvard is the 3rd largest employer in Mass.

"Fun fact: Harvard's endowment isn't just a large pile of ""do-whatever-the-hell-you-like"" money.  It's many separate investments from which Harvard draws only the interest.  And each investment comes with lots of strings attached (only to be used for engineering disciplines, only to be used for medical students from India, etc.)  so they are legally not allowed to just go spend it on whatever you would have them do.

It's also less than Apple's quarterly income - so maybe not not quite as large when put into perspective.

"Most of my work at Subaru was done in C.  However, most observatories (Subaru included) are using lots of Python these days. AstroPy is also very popular (astronomy python extensions).

A good grip of HTML5, CSS, webGL, SVG, and Javascript is also very important because many observatory programs have web front-ends (or SPA front-ends) these days.

Obviously you end up learning a lot of things about FITS (the file format used in astronomy), FITS viewers, etc.

But most software of this type is custom designed because the instruments and devices we are interfacing to are all custom designed (and in many cases, the only such devices in the world).

There is some call for machine language - especially in RT (real-time) application work (things like adaptive optics, which have to deform mirrors in real-time).

As for experience - you pretty much just needed to be good at coding, debugging, and being very proactive (observatories are very expensive and mistakes may cost millions).

The more languages you know, the more applications you've written (even on your own), the more experience you have doing concept to delivery - the more they will want you.

Having math, physics, etc - is icing on the cake - but not necessary (unless you are gong into those specific fields where such knowledge is required - like orbital dynamics, etc).",1

"Hi.  I've got a BS in CS and worked for NASA (Goddard Space Flight Center) and recently retired from a world class astronomical observatory.

All major observatories are completely computer run... from the movement of the dome and scope, to the instruments that do the viewing.  It is all computers and in most cases, a ton of custom software.

Likewise, at NASA - there are a huge number of software opportunities.

I do not recommend going past a BS in CS.  Job experience is way more important.  It all comes down to how versatile you are (in knowledge), how much you have done (complete applications, etc), how you work in teams, or independently, how proactive you are, etc.

A BS in CS opens just about every field in science to you.

As a suggestion, if you want to work at NASA, it is better to do so as a contractor (eg., through a company like Computer Sciences Corporation) than with the government.  Mainly, the pay is much better as a contractor.",1

"You likely can't make out the bands because even with the hyperstar, your field of view with that camera is so small that all you are capturing is the central core of the galaxy and is also likely why things look like a blur as the core naturally has a ""fuzzy"" look. Focusing with a hyperstar is a pita and collimation needs to be spot on so those are other considerations.  You may also be taking too short of exposures to bring out any fainter detail or not using enough exposures in your stack.  Pics and more details on how you are capturing would help.",1

"The 20' tube and 15"" aperture mean that it's an [f/16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number) system, which means that you can get a lot of magnification but have a narrow field of view.  That in turn makes this a good scope for looking at planets - as, indeed, /u/Andromeda321 mentioned it was used to discover Saturn's moon Hyperion - but this scope is not as good for conducting wide-field surveys.",1

"**Great Comet of 1843**

The Great Comet of 1843, formally designated C/1843 D1 and 1843 I, was a long-period comet which became very bright in March 1843 (it is also known as the Great March Comet). It was discovered on February 5, 1843 and rapidly brightened to become a great comet. It was a member of the Kreutz Sungrazers, a family of comets resulting from the breakup of a parent comet (X/1106 C1) into multiple fragments in about 1106. These comets pass extremely close to the surface of the Sun—within a few solar radii—and often become very bright as a result.

"Harvard's notes on the [Great Refractor](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hco/grref.html) mention the [Great Comet of 1843](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Comet_of_1843).  What the notes don't directly mention is one way they twisted arms to get donations.  There was a tremendous amount of public interest in this comet, which led to interest in astronomy in general.  Harvard said to their alums and other donors, ""It's a shame we don't have a world-class instrument to study astronomical phenomena like these.  Why, Yale has a sufficient telescope.  It's a real shame we don't.""  The Harvard-Yale rivalry has been going on quite a while.

Another story I've been told about this scope is that when it was commissioned, Harvard sent someone over to Merz and Mahler (the company which was commissioned) in Munich to examine the lens.  Merz and Mahler had orders to produce two of these lenses, and Harvard wanted to be sure they got the best one.  The inspector - I've forgotten who it was - examined the lenses and performed a number of tests on them, then etched his name along the side so Harvard could be sure the one delivered was the one which he'd inspected.  The other lens went to a similar refractor in Russia, I believe.",1
My question &amp; theory exactly - thank you for your response!,1
"Ah ha! Thank you, that makes so much more sense. My bad then.",1
15 inches is the size of the lens at the end of the telescope tube.  The tube itself is [20' long](https://historyplaces.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/the-great-refractor-at-harvard/).,1
Usually telescopes are measured by the objective diameter.,1
i don't think that was built on 1840,1
"There is nothing you can do. You are shuttled into tight interior spaces with ""windows"" (can be screens) and then you ""experience"" the lift off, the ascent and the floaty. You see out of the screen windows. These experiences can be ""mimicked"" with VR and motion controls. (Like those fully encased virtual coasters) If math and practical experimentation can't sway them, gimmicky action rides won't do the trick either..........",1
"....15 inches can’t be correct, but that’s how this reads. 15 feet should be written 15’ 

Still cool though.",1
If they get taken up and they watch the world spin like a globe.........,1
"If they get taken up and see the curvature, they’ll just say it’s CGI or a fish eye lens. There’s nothing you can really do.",1
"It’s funny cause they don’t actually have proof the Earth is flat, only counter arguments to the Earth being round.",1
Yeah but those are the ones that ”survived”. Is there any data on how much the sun’s mass increases by in terms of how much it consumes?,1
"Here's a better question, how come none of the insane flat-earthers will ask people like Elon musk to take them up and see for themselves?",1
"That may have happened but it certainly wasn't the last time it was opened.  It's functional right now, as far as I know.  I was up there using it recently.",1
Not the way to prove a spherical Earth. Atmospheric distortion is kind of a nuisance (especially in astronomy). There are many other easy answers that are ignored by the infamous flat earthers though,1
"Crescent on the moon just means the moon is round, nothing about the Earth. Other points are valid.",1
You’ve described the origin of many asteroids in our solar system. Lots of them are either fragments of protoplanet crusts or some are dormant cores of said protoplanets.,1
Thank you for looking,1
Thanks man it's on the borderline of debate whether it's 4k or not.  It's really close,1
Hmmm just depends.  If I were to give a ballpark estimate of what my gear that I used costs I would probably say 3k+ maybe closer to 4k.  But I've seen images like mine if not better with less money spent on gear.,1
"The issue with you argument is that we don´t know if the line of sight is straight. Actually, we know it is not, atmospheric refraction curves light. Under normal conditions it makes objects appear higher than they are (opposite to the effect of earth curvature). The earth looks flatter than it is when you consider intervisibility at long distances. Under thermal inversion conditions the effect of refraction has the same sing than earth curvature, the earth would seem to have higher curvature.

Someone defending the idea of flat earth may say that we don't see Morocco because of refraction. In reality, refraction minimizes de effect of the earth curvature, but we would need to measure the effect of refraction before we can use intervisibility to  prove/disprove flat earth theories.

As a side note, I am a surveyor and we use the same model to correct refraction and earth curvature effect on elevation observations, just with different radius of curvature.",1
"Cool. 15 "" is huge for a refractor. I wish there was a human in the picture to give an idea if its size.",1
"I’m only guessing at this.

The further you see the further through the atmosphere you look. 

Built up molecules over distance would obscure vision. You would only be able to see so far!

See how far your telescope can see through NYC in the morning. 

I think if you were on Mercury you could see as far as you wanted because there is no atmosphere.
Or sound for that matter. I think.",1

This galaxy, known as Centaurus A recently had a small jet discovered in within it by a team of scientists in 2017! Initially, I had thought I had captured this jet, however, there are two ""outer jets"" for this galaxy, the one here is the brighter of the two and not more recently discovered. Shame! However, I ended up finding a 120+ hours exposure on this target by an amateur, and they still were unable to image the jet. Crazy to think just how much better scientific equipment is compared to what amateurs have available to us. 


Thanks for looking!",1
good lol. i don't know why this theory popped into my head,1
No. I am going to agree. Because the earth is round. There are too many things that say that it is. Cresent on the moon. The lunar eclipse. The fact that ships appear to sink over the horizon. Common sense.,1
"The atmosphere would block you. Not to mention any solid object in the way. Think of it as really light fog. Over a large enough distance, the light-blocking effect adds up enough that you can't see any further",1
"Cool, thanks for sharing! I looked at Saturn through this scope in the summer of 2001 while visiting a friend.",1
"The story I've been told about that is that the last time the dome was opened, the shutter got stuck in the ""open"" position.  Fortunately it didn't rain for the few days it took to get it closed again, but they needed to call in some professors from Mechanical Engineering to consult on it.

Harvard has some notes on [the history of the Great Refractor](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hco/grref.html).",1
It was the biggest telescope in the Americas at the time and was used to discover Saturn’s moon Hyperion and take the first detailed astrophotography. Note the wooden casing and the velvet double seat the astronomer would sit in- his son would also sit there to take notes.,1

"**Image Details**

The Soul Nebula is an emission nebula located in Cassiopeia. Several small open clusters are embedded in the nebula: CR 34, 632, and 634 (in the head) and IC 1848 (in the body).

The object is more commonly called by the cluster designation IC 1848.

It's nickname probably stems from the fact that it is close by to the Heart Nebula.

With light pollution even worse now that snow is on the ground, I used narrowband filters to block it out. The Soul Nebula was captured and processed in the Hubble Palette.

For more of my work check out [my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/gorilla_astro/) clear skies!

Located in the constellation Ursa major (big Dipper area) at 21 million light years away, m101 is a face on Galaxy with a lot to show

Discovered by Pierre Mechain on March 27th 1781. Later sent to Charles messier to verify its position and be included in the catalogue.

M101 spans a diameter of 170,000 light years. A large Galaxy indeed but still doesn't beat our home Galaxy which is 258,000 light years in diameter. However! M101 has estimated 1 trillion stars about twice as much as our home the milky way galaxy. Quite impressive indeed!

This Galaxy is asymmetrical due to the strong gravitational forces of it's neighboring galaxies. This causes many strong star forming regions in it's spiral arms. 
In dark skies this object is best seen in telescopes with apetures of 8+ inches, but don't let that stop you from using what equipment you have to view the cosmos with.

"What you see 'live' through a telescope, either with your eyes or with a digital feed, or with a quick photo, is unfortunately nothing as amazing as this. Our photo receptors in our eyes are only excited for a fraction of a second when a few of these photos fall on them, giving you a dim, hazy, low resolution version of this. The only way to see something with detail like this is with exposures so you can let the photons 'collect' so to speak.

The best you are going to see of something like the Andromeda galaxy with your real eyes looking through even a really good telescope is something like this...

Pre-processing:

Checked for bad frames in Blink, registered and stacked in Deep sky stacker using kappa sigma clipping

Processing:

Processing mostly done in Pixinsight. First I combined three images, a stack of 10 minute exposures, 30 second exposures and 5 second exposures using the HDRComposition tool. This gives the image a higher dynamic range to work on the blown-out core. Cropped the image to get rid of artefacts from the dithering. Then used MultiscaleLinearTransform for reducing the noise in the linear stage. DBE for extracting the background, which was particularly difficult to get right with all the nebulosity everywhere! Histogram transformation tool used to stretch the image, going into the non-linear phase. HDRMultiscaleTransform tool used to bring out the core detail, also making the stars visible in the trapezium. Then I applied ACDNR to further reduce the noise and smooth out the dust lanes using a range mask. I created a clone of the image to use as a luminance mask, where I applied local histogram equalisation for bringing out more detail in the nebula and surrounding dust. I then created another range mask, used for bringing out the dust and darkening the background. This was done in multiple iterations to get it right. I used more iterations of curves adjustments and local histogram equalisation to further enhance the detail. Then I sharpened up the core. Then I took the image into Photoshop CS2 and ran some astronomy actions. Make stars smaller was applied to reduce the star size further, making the eyes more drawn to the dust as opposed to the stars. Less crunchy more fuzzy helps to give the image a more 3D feel, so it isn’t flat looking. Local contrast enhancement particularly helped the region between Orion and running man. Finally, I saved the image and rotated it to my liking.",1

It is apparent in the Earth-Moon system, where the Moon orbits slower than the Earth rotates. (Earth spins every 24 hours, Moon revolves around Earth every 29 days or so. As a result, the Moon is slowing the Earth's rotation down due to its gravitational force.) Sorry if that's complicated, it's really hard to explain, but the same thing happens with Mercury.",1

One exception is the orion nebula which is, as afore mentioned, visible to the naked eye, even in moderately light polluted areas (under good conditions of course).

Furthermore I believe that longer exposures with a narrowband filter were necessary to fully expose all the clouds in and around Orion. 

However, there might be other deep sky objects you could seek out with your binoculars, such as the ring nebula, aka M57. Be warned though, it won't be so colorful as it is shown in many images all over interwebs. This again would require multiple narrowband filters and longtime exposures.",1

"I am going to quote Wikipedia here as it does a better job explaining than I could. Firstly, you need to understand the general structure of Jupiter's atmosphere.

&gt; The visible surface of Jupiter is divided into several bands parallel to the equator. There are two types of bands: lightly colored zones and relatively dark belts.[6] The wider Equatorial Zone (EZ) extends between latitudes of approximately 7°S to 7°N. Above and below the EZ, the North and South Equatorial belts (NEB and SEB) extend to 18°N and 18°S, respectively. Farther from the equator lie the North and South Tropical zones (NtrZ and STrZ).[6] The alternating pattern of belts and zones continues until the polar regions at approximately 50 degrees latitude, where their visible appearance becomes somewhat muted.[31] The basic belt-zone structure probably extends well towards the poles, reaching at least to 80° North or South.[6]

...

&gt; The Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows (winds), called jets. The eastward (prograde) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward (retrograde) jets mark the transition from belts to zones.[6] Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, wind shear in belts is cyclonic, while in zones it is anticyclonic.[22] The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100 m/s.[6] These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7–1 bar. The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets.[6] The vertical extent of jets is not known. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter

You can get an idea of this from this animation; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#/media/File%3APIA02863_-_Jupiter_surface_motion_animation.gif

&gt; Zones, belts and vortices on Jupiter. The wide equatorial zone is visible in the center surrounded by two dark equatorial belts (SEB and NEB). The large grayish-blue irregular ""hot spots"" at the northern edge of the white Equatorial Zone change over the course of time as they march eastward across the planet. The Great Red Spot is at the southern margin of the SEB. Strings of small storms rotate around northern-hemisphere ovals. Small, very bright features, possible lightning storms, appear quickly and randomly in turbulent regions. The smallest features visible at the equator are about 600 kilometers across. This 14-frame animation spans 24 Jovian days, or about 10 Earth days. The passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000. The occasional black spots in the image are moons of Jupiter getting into the field of view.

Or here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot#/media/File%3AJupiter_Great_Red_Spot_Animation.gif

&gt; The cyclic motion of the Great Red Spot, imaged by the Cassini spacecraft

Now how does the great red spots latitude fit into this?

&gt; Careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the Great Red Spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager fly-bys.[22] The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.[23] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about 432 km/h (268 mph), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[24] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[25]

&gt; The Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[26] Because Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10 degrees and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot of 9h 55m 42s.[27] Despite this, however, the spot has ""lapped"" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[28]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot

So, the tldr, it is confined to it's present longitude by an east to west jet to the north and by a west to east jet to it's south. Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics are far more complicated than those on earth.",1
"We can’t see with our eyes the closer stars appearing to move more than the stars further away as we travel at on the earth at great speeds. Like if in a car, the trees next to the road wiz past but mountains far away seem to move past slower. But with super precision instruments on satellites we can see this apparent movement and calculate there distance using predominantly trigonometry. This is only how I understand. Hope this clarifies it.",1

This gets reposted more than a year in Mercury,1
"The sky is full of nebulas visible in a moderate telescope, Orion's nebula is visible to the naked eye.

The Flame Nebula is magnitude 2, well within the grasp of most binoculars.",1
"&gt;The red spot doesn't change latitude  . . .   Does anyone understand how it can maintain latitude? 

I don't know that I can totally explain it, but many of the bands and borders between different bands that we see on Jupiter are created by boundaries between high-speed winds that circle the planet at a certain latitude.

So anything like a storm that would try to cross those wind-bands would just be ripped to shreds.

You can see an animation of the movement of some of those bands here: [https://youtu.be/IMT56HweN2g](https://youtu.be/IMT56HweN2g)

One of the amazing/entertaining things you can watch if you follow Jupiter weather is what happens when say two blobs collided--do they merge, does one eat the other, etc.  Of course the ""blogs"" are all giant storms of one kind or another with high winds and other atmospheric effects going on, so you're basically watching two giant storms collide.

Barnard's loop spans all over the orion constellation, iirc. and it is very dim. basically just dark. you would need a lot of long, high quality exposures to make a decent picture of it.

what is most visible around alnitak are flame and horsehead nebulas. forget the barnards loop.",1
"Wow, now that is interesting.",1
The better question IMO is how did any of them slow down?  Stuff falls in at escape velocity.,1
"Alnitak's light is the main source for the ionization of the nebular complex and the nebbular has a larger area in the sky than the apparent size of the star from Earth, so thats why. However thats makes sense, considering unlike Orion, that nebula probably isnt as bright and thus most parts of it aren't visible unless its a really powerful telescope.",1
Jupiter rotates in 9 hour 55 minutes.  Earth 23:56.  The RPM is much faster.  The larger radius multiplies making it that much more.,1
"Well I know that. I considered adding more. I was just too lazy, to be honest.",1
It is the rotational speed.,1
Oh so the 23h 56min number just doesn’t take into account the fact that the earth is moving around the sun?,1
After 182 days the Earth is on the other side of the solar system.  When you look up and see Orion at midnight it will be 182 days before Orion is directly behind the Sun.  So the Sun is 12 hours out of position.  You can do this with any constellation.,1

It is not the “speed” it is frequency.  If two objects have the same rpm the surface is speedier on the large object.  Earth and Mars rotate close to once per day.  Days are about the same.  Earth’s equator moves much faster than Mars’ equator.,1
"I'll try an ELI5:

Like you said they are extremely huge. Now take the rotational axis and look at the rotation as a change of angle. The further you are away from the center (rotational axis) the faster you have to be in order to keep the pace of the the angle changing.

So basically a similar rotation as the rest that just looks faster because the diameter of the planet is bigger.",1

"&gt; &gt; Only at its equator. Balls of gas rotate slower the farther from the equator
&gt; That’s true of rocky planets too.

Yes, but it's even *more* true with balls of gas.  With rocky planets, the entire surface rotates at a fairly constant angular velocity regardless of latitude.  With Jupiter, the angular velocity *drops* with increasing latitude.  System I, within ten degrees of the equator, revolves once every 9h50m.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), known by sailors as the doldrums or the calms because of its monotonous, windless weather, is the area where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator, though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough, a usage more common in Australia and parts of Asia.

godammit now i’m completely hooked haha,1
"All of us will pop out of existence when it eventually explodes, but thankfully just your great-great-great-great-grand children will die from it.",1
Can you send me this please?,1
"I don't know why, I always keep looking for Pluto. :P",1
"For Neptune, giant collision in the early solar system is the current theory.

For Venus, collisions have been proposed before, but also drag by its large atmosphere over billions of years is a possible explanation.",1
It's uncanny that the Earth and Mars have such a similar length of time for one day.,1
"Nah, still not even kind of close to big leagues. The sun itself isn’t even in the big leagues amongst other stars.",1
"Those are about revolution (orbit around sun), which unfortunately doesn't amount to an exact number of days (rotations). There's a leftover of about 0,2425, so we up it to 0,25 and add it every 4 years, with another correction for the remainder once it actually amounts to something.

Not too sure but I believe we skip a leap year once in a while to make it all add up, more or less. As time passes, calculations get more accurate so we may need to intervene in 5000 years to add a february 30 or something silly like that.",1
Why do Venus and Uranus rotate from East to West while the other planets rotate West to East?,1
"Yep, both planets are upside down",1
Venus too. Just really slow.,1
"No, the solar day is exactly 24 hours. The time they are showing there is the sidereal day. http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Sidereal+Day

Leap days and leap years come into play because one orbit around the sun isn't an exact number of days and need to be adjusted for.",1
This is amazing,1
"And to answer the other part of the question, all planets rotational speed causes them to be wider around the equated than along any line of longitude running over the poles. Jupiter has the highest rotational speed and the highest ratio of equator circumference to pole circumference.

The rotational speed also creates effects in weather patterns due to the Coriolis effect. If you look at hurricane tracks on earth you can see this. Hurricanes spin, and general travel direction are governed by this effect.

"I’m extremely skeptical of any claims found in a subreddit implicit towards alternate science with no significant scientific backing. I’ve heard of it, never gave it any serious consideration",1
I'm wondering what your thoughts on the r/glitch_in_the_matrix sub is? It often includes stories of people witnessing objects or even people just ceasing to exist,1
"It’s not possible for ANYTHING to cease existing, let alone an entire star",1
Venus lazy ass get off that damn couch,1
No,1
"not a single planet:

Jupiter: i am speed

Uranus: it's rewind time!",1
Do leap days/years also help make up for the fact that earth’s rotation is four minutes off or does that only help with the orbit being slightly off?,1
"Everybody be rotating counterclockwise and
 there's Uranus.",1
I didn't know Uranus rotates counterclockwise. That's trippy! ELI5 why it moves in the opposite direction?,1
"Just a student, but my guess is that due to more in-falling matter that contributes to angular momentum, the rotation rate will be faster compared to rock planets.",1
"It was just me or I read this with ""things"" in my mind?",1
Did UK find Uranus?,1
Lol yeah what the hell was I doing?,1
"That means that the surface of Jupiter is travelling around its axis at about 27,300mph (compared to us here at a mere 1000mph).",1
"Can I ask, why is it, or how is it, that significantly larger planets like Jupiter and Saturn rotate so fast? Considering they are gas giants does that disturb the surfsce or atmoshpere at all?",1
Uranus should be spinning perpendicular to the rest though right?,1
That looks like good a good APOD entry.,1
do a barrel roll!,1
"&gt; Orion ED80T CF

Astronomy is the passion which inspires you to earn more and more to purchase the great equipments to get such great results.

This is awesome shot",1
we are close to a new moon.. that is the sun.,1
"Yes, the sun will be way to hard to follow without motorized tracking.",1
That’s such a helpful visualization of relative speed!,1
"Thanks for ur answer! But I know that this image is not what you see trough a telescope, that is why I asked the question because all I see is pictures of hours exposure and I was just wandering what you see if you just see trough them.",1
"I mean, given how overcast it is i wouldn't think you'd be able so see the moon at all, let alone so clearly.  So, its probably the sun.  Or a lantern stuck in the tree.",1
"Dunno mate, don't come from 'round here",1
May need to check your division there.,1
What you think? Could it be moon ?,1
ok,1
woah,1
Are you okay? Uranus is looking kinda blue...,1
"Ok, I give up. You just don’t want to understand and you are incapable of even understanding extremely simple concepts like scaling.",1
I'm Sorry but I don't understand your last sentence..,1
"Okay I already understand there are huge distances, but scaling it down doesn't change anything, it just helps to imagine huge distances. 

In the microcosmos, even 2 micrometers are a huge difference if we need to calculate anything! So if we scale it back up, there should be visible/measurable differences every hour, or am I missing something? 

It's just logical that stars which are moving with the same speed as we do, look like they are standing still, but what about all the other stars moving at a different speed and direction?",1
"Awesome!!! Congratulations, great video",1
You would be blinded by it's majesty,1
Ok I definitely have to check that out,1
Thank you for your time and I appreciate your answer,1
Do you recommend tracking mounts for solar scopes?,1
Now you can send it to DBZ and they have a real footage of it in their intro!!😍,1
Beautiful and deadly at the same time. It makes you appreciate being safe here on Earth.. for now. Can’t say the same for any creatures existing in about 3-5 billion years.,1
"To exoplanets, it’s an exoplanet.",1
Can you in layman terms tell me what we are seeing here? Not exactly the barrel roll itself though why is this part of the sun different? Does it have any affect with the heat to earth?,1
Lol def the big league. I don’t think I’ve ever used that terminology before.,1
Speed = Distance / Time,1
"Speed = Distance / Time

The Earth is 7917 miles in diameter. 2.5 of those is 19,792. Divide by 2 and you get about 9896mph.",1
"Probably a stupid question, but; how does the telescope stay focused on the sun for two hours? I assume the position of the sun relative to the telescope would change in that time? Auto-tracking device? Manual correction?",1
"If you can find the paper after it was published in a journal, better to cite that instead, but if not then arxiv is okay.  Do a quick search for the paper title on scholar.google.com.",1
"The earth is 7,917.5 miles in diameter. 7,917.5 miles per earth X 2.5 earths = 19,793.75 miles / 2 hours = 9,896.875 miles per hour.

Unless he meant 2.5 earth circumferences. The earth is 24,901 miles in circumference. 24,901 miles per earth X 2.5 earths = 62,252.5 miles / 2 hours = 31,126.25 miles per hour.

In contrast, the ISS travels around the earth at 17,150 miles per hour and takes 90 mins to do a full orbit. That solar flare is moving almost twice that speed! If you've ever see the ISS in the sky at night, sure does make you feel pretty small and insignificant. Pretty amazing though!",1
"That could loop around the entire earth with room to spare .

(and char it beyond recognition)",1
Truly breathtaking footage,1
"I just checked the name. The Gaia space craft is currently 3D mapping the milky way using parallax. See stars move relative to us no, measure that relative movement I believe so.",1
"&gt; I understand what you're saying, but it's not only us moving right?    
    
You are right. And actually our neighbor star is basically moving at the same speed as we are. Because the speed you mentioned is the speed we move relative to the galactic center, and out neighbor star is moving along with us. The real relative speed between us and our neighbor star is just a tiny fraction of 720,000km/h.    
  
Anyhow let's imagine we still would go at that crazy speed relative to it.   
  
Let's scale it down so that Proxima Centauri is 100m away from you. And when you now scale down that speed you mentioned accordingly you come to a speed of around 2 micrometers/ hour. So within one day you wouldn't move more than half the thickness of a human hair.  
So you think the next day the star should be at a complete other spot than the night before?  
Over an entire year you would have moved no more than half an inch.",1
4953 mph,1
"not only galaxy, its the entire universe",1
"its an approximate prediction, but think of looking at the closest star, thats the first star to move.

 if you are observing the sky for a long time. then any velocity will be enough to be able to spot the sky moving if u wait long enough. but if you dont want to spend years of observations. travelling at 0.1 ly/second you would immediately see changes. as looking through a carwindow",1
Thank you I will watch it this evening,1
"You know you're in the big leagues when the unit of measurement is ""earths"".",1
"Haha funny you point that out now, I was just about to ask if there is a galaxy simulation anywhere available.",1
"Stars do move from our point of view, just really really slow. This is how Orion will change in the next 450,000 years. https://youtu.be/RTBc-FjNhD0",1
"Yeah I know it's impossible for the earth to do that, it was just a theoretically question..

That sounds interesting and would look pretty awesome, why is it exactly 0.1 lightyear per second, or is it just an approximate prediction?",1
"Lol I had my first real conversation with one yesterday. Wow!

It was an experience to remember, the dude actually believed the sun was smaller than the earth bc it looks small he said. He even owned a telescope, I asked if he had liked through it before and he said no.

After 4 hours chatting he finally did it, he thought satellites were fake. I mean jeez take a looksy lol

They seem to avoid things and come up with these experiments for you to do, yet they dismiss science altogether. It’s quite funny.

It always ends the same way, explain an eclipse. That’s it. Lol",1
We see the planets in our solar system move around precisely because they are quite close. Stars are really really far.,1
"if you are into this stuff, you should check out ""Space engine"" a simulation of the universe on steam :) but fair warning: you will probably have an existential crisis.",1
"Sounds good to me, thank you for being one of the people in here, who is interested in answering my questions, I will look further into this.",1
"the earth will never be able to move fast enough, the earth would need to break the orbit from the sund and move in a straight line for us to see a change in the sky fast enough. 

but its a good question. 

&gt;much faster does the earth need to move


moving at about 0.1 lightyear  per second  would make the closest stars to move away from us clearly. and if we would move at that speed we would clearly see the sky change before our eyes",1
"Maybe it's because of the diffrent threads I'm following, they think everyone is a flat earther nowadays.

Most of the time it's really helpful, but there are always a few just insulting and ridicule others",1
"All stars move in the same direction around the galaxy. There might be some small differences in how fast they move, but it takes millions of years to make it discernable.",1
"I unterstand what you're saying, but it's not only us moving right? They should move too and the light reaching us need to be at a complete other spot than the night before...

I think I got some thinking issues with this..",1
"its the sheer size and distance, our planets are right in front of our nose and we can see some of them even without aid.

but the stars are so far away and the time it would take to notice a change takes multiple lifetimes. im no expert in the subject but I think there have been reported multiple changes in the sky since the first astronomers starting mapping the sky.",1
"No I'm not taking about reaching them, I know how that would work. I'm talking about, how much faster does the earth need to move, that see different star constellations every night",1
"Tbh I’ve found this page really helpful, nearly everyone I’ve chatted to has gone out of there way to educate me or at least direct me. I ask some pretty simple stuff.",1
"Ok, that's a game changer, but don't they all need to move at the same speed around the center of our galaxy to be at the same spot every night?

Not even the planets in our tiny solarsystem move at the same speed, so we can't see them every day at the same spot, why is it with stars?",1
"It will take around 100,000 years before most of the constellations have become unrecognisable. 720,000 km/h sounds fast, but it's not when considering that out closest neighbor star is 40,000,000,000,000 km away",1
and the radius of the milky way is 52 850 lightyears,1
"yeah we would need to reach velocities alot faster than that. since the closest star, alpha centauri, is a couple lf lightYEARS away(4.3). the time it takes for light to reach us takes 4 years. so travelling at light speed it takes 4 years. and the constellations we see in the sky. Orions belt for example are 1360 lightyears. so you would need to travel for a thousand years at lightspeed before you would reach those stars",1
"Yeah maybe it's about timing in here, it's just frustrating to see people answering like this..

They only try to make me look dumb without saying anything useful. 
Thank you for pointing that out.

I really like to guess too, but most of the people will only come at you with inulsts and hate..

Even being politely is useless sometimes",1
"&gt;Maybe I'm wrong, but not all of the stars we are able to see at night are inside the milky-way right?

thats right, the stars you see when u look up at night without aid, are 99.99% in the milky way. we can spot andromeda(our neighbouring galaxy) as a dim spot sometimed if the conditions are right. but thats about it.",1
"How fast do we need to be to move out? 

Because if we are not seeing a slight change at this speed, we need to go way faster than 720.000km, right?",1
"I totally agree on every star in the milky way, because they move with us, but what about the stars outside?

Maybe I'm wrong, but not all of the stars we are able to see at night are inside the milky-way right?",1
"I think you just have bad timing mate, I read your question and I’d like to know too,

What I think he means is, if it’s travels away at speed why does it look the same everyday.

The only answer I see is the universe is bigger than you think, no shit Sherlock.",1
"Earth spins on its axis and rotates around the sun. The solar system (and everything in it) rotates around a black hole at the core of our galaxy... The galaxy is also hurdling through empty space. 
While sitting there you feel stationary but in fact you’re moving at several hundred miles per second(iirc).",1
"if we where to move in a spaceship going really fast

&gt;yes we would eventually move out so that the constellations we see are no longer there.",1
"yes we would eventually move out so that the constellations we see are no longer there. but since we are in the milky way, all the stars in the milky wat are rotating around the galaxys nucleus. since gravity affects them all",1
"So altough we are moving at that speed, we never change our point of view? Even stars which aren't moving with us are visible for many years every night?

Are there some scientific explanations out there I could read about it?",1
🔥,1
"Wooooow, it gives you a perspective on how big the sun is! 

Thanks!",1
"I didn't downvote your question, why should I do that .. It's okay if you're thinking I'm a troll, but I just want to learn things I don't know already.

Thanks for giving me advice, but I never asked about that and I don't think you're the one who should give people advice. 

I didn't know following diffrent communities in here is forbidden, but I already recognized, being open minded and asking questions nowadays will only bring hatred.

If you're not interested in answering my question, please just leave and don't waste my time, thank you",1
its cause its HUUGE,1
Outstanding imaging and a marvelous detail.,1
"The fact that you downvoted a simple question speaks volumes. We can't have a conversation. No surprise there though. Conspiracy, paranormal, earth is level are few of the subreddits you like. So, my bad for answering to a troll post. Maybe if you stay away from internet and go to school will do you good. But I doubt.",1

"Already answered this useful comment from another guy

If you are interested in answering my question please read it, if you're just here to make me look dumb, please leave, thank you",1
You don’t have a clue on the scale of the Galaxy or Universe.,1
"Yes I know, but even with that huge scale, we should move away from some of them right? Even if we still could see them, shouldn't they be in a different constellation, because of our changed point of view?",1
Do you even understand the scale of the universe?,1

Heh. Didn't know it had anything to do with 40k.,1
"I’m gonna take a flying leap of a guess and say that N14 releases less energy when fused than the preceding processes.  Less energy released means less outward force against gravity.  Core shrinks and provides additional pressure to fuse N14.

Also with more N14 other reactants are less in contact with each other.  The fuel is diluted, so to speak.  Again less energy to push back on gravity therefore collapsing the core further.

How’s my aim?",1

"Incredible stuff, feels unreal that it's even possible for a normal telescope to capture this. Thanks for sharing!",1
"We all living in 2020, meanwhile this guy taking pictures of aliens living in 2,500,000 BC.",1
"Well, number 1 the OP isn't using a $100 telescope from Walmart, that's for sure. And number 2, he is doing a 6 hour exposure, which means he is letting all the light come in over 6 hours (instead of a fraction of a second like a normal photograph) and let all the light add to itself and form a much brighter, sharper image, which is then combined digitally in a program to make this finished image.",1
"I wish we could see Andromeda in all its beauty like this with the naked eye, it would be amazing to see.

And FYI, it's not that Andromeda is too small, it takes up a whopping 2 degrees of your field of view lengthwise (which is 4x the diameter of the moon), it's just so dim overall, and that dimness is spread over the entire 2 degrees.

It is plenty big, it just needs to be brighter.

I'll give it a few billion years, and I'll get my wish. I might be so old I'll need glasses by then though.",1

"**Image Details**

I captured this sun prominence just in time to capture a cool swirling effect on one side.

It consists of 135 frames across 2 hours. I originally captured 178 frames but the wind, bad seeing, and bad tracking caused me to throw away over 40 frames. I am still happy with the result and love watching it go.

"&gt;I think I’m on the wrong sub wasting real astronomers time here.

We're always happy to help someone who's interested.",1
"&gt; hmmm now wonder why there is no streamers?

several reasons:

\- if you're streaming through your telescope you're not looking through it (or taking pictures) unless you have a second telescope.

\- most streams would be just one view of the same small piece of sky for hour upon hour.

\- it needs extra equipment and network connection which might not be available at the telescope.

Cosmos Now is one of the few who does live stream their observing but it really isn't very exciting most of the time, more like relaxing backround.

Then using pixel math combination to create the RGB color space image.
Several Curves, colour saturations (in PI) and Selective color in PS to get the colours you see. 
Then this RGB color space image was made starless with starnet.

Then 2 rounds of LHE were applied to Ha image using a range mask that first targeted the bright regions and then the dark

Star reduction was then performed by using mophological erosion and a starnet starmask that was binarized and then covoluted.

Then I applied a new technique I have created that aims to remove small faint stars from the image. Because after star reduction an image may have lots of little reduced stars that make the background quite noisy.

The technique is as follows: 

Create star mask with starnet.
Binarize the starmask to remove the unwanted small stars. Dilate the remaining stars back to roughly original size if not a little bigger. Convolute this mask.
Now using a starless copy of the original image, apply this starmask to it. Then add the original image with stars back in with pixel math. Only those stars that conform to the starmask will be put back in. Any small stars lost in the binarize will fail to be added.


LRGB combination was then done with this edited Ha and the starless RGB color space image.

Further contrast curves and saturation was applied.
ACDNR on L with a inverted stretched luminance mask was then applied.

Very stronk,1
"Firstly these stars are not in the same plane. They just coincidentally happen to be in the right positions and have the right luminosity to look like they are in the same plane.  The middle star Alnilam is the farthest from us at ~1400 light years while Alnitak is the closest at ~ 840 Light years. Mintaka is around 1000 LY from the sun. From that you could figure out the relative distance between each of them.  And the crazy thing is none of the stars are single. IIRC, Mintaka is a three body system. Two of them are super small compared to the main star. The other stars also have small companion stars but I don’t remember the exact numbers. So at any given period of time , their distances from us shift by almost as much as a few light days back and forth because of the orbit of the main star around the  system.",1
stronk bone,1
Unfortunately I don't have the videos themselves uoloaded anyway at this stage,1

Its the meteorite that contains the third oldest material on Earth, after Murchison and the Hypatia Stone.",1
"Just something I wanted to add, but I think the one collectible every astronomy lover should own own is a carbonaceous chondrite stony meteorite. Holding one is about the closest you can come to holding your very own piece of a nebula, similar to the Carin Nebula in this photo. Obviously most meteorites come from the asteroid belt, bassically just our close backyard when it comes to interstellar space, but chondrite contain some of the earliest material from our Solar System that was formed in a presolar nebula very similar to this one, 4.5 billion years ago. Some of the calcium inclusions and chondrules may have been melted into beads from nearby supernova.",1

"&gt;So would an astronomer rather be in the Northen Hemisphere?

Ideally you'd want access to both.

Because of the tilt of the Earth the northern hemisphere has access to more galaxies to image or view (M31, M51, M81/M82, etc) compared to the south.

In contrast, the southern hemisphere is tilted more towards our galaxy, so there are a lot more nebulae to view there, and the milky way stretches across the entire sky instead of half of it being hidden by the horizon. The planets also go directly overhead in parts of Australia, so the viewing experience is significantly better than for people in the UK or Canada.

Please read the sticky on r/telescopes if you're interested in buying a scope, and stay away from any powerseeker telescopes. Also download Stellarium on your computer because it will simulate the night sky at your location.",1
"Taken October 2019, just on the outskirts of Reykjavík. 
I'd gone over to Iceland a few days earlier than some friends and had a fairly strong aurora come through the days before - luckily this came up on the night they arrived, so they didn't miss out on the show either.

"Altitude and azimuth can alter your perception of the night sky. [Here](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys373/lectures/radec/radec.html) is an article on Celestial Coordinates. 

Put simply, Altitude is the distance that the object appears above the local horizon. Azimuth, which I had to look up again, is a measure of the direction of a celestial body in reference to North.

While they're a small group I think they do provide a service to humanity as a whole. Their science is valuable to many people. But there is a difference between science and viewing /photography. Much of what is essentially being argued is the value of each of those things.

Watched a discussion on Starlink from a recent astronomy conference a few days ago and they pointed out how many of the astronomers were using the very same language and arguments to voice their disagreements on Starlink as the people who are against the 30 meter telescope. It seemed to be lost on the speakers (not the commenters). I can't remember who it was exactly as it was a random link in a comment. One is a youtuber the other was a PHD astronomer.",1

"&gt;Imo it’s no different to a building blocking the view of the lake or mountains from your house

Well you have to have the right conditions to see them with the naked eye and as long as they're successful with their luminosity reductions they likely shouldn't be able to be seen at all by the naked eye. So while I can kind of see where you're coming from there, it doesn't seem like a one to one comparison since blocking a view is constant. But seems like a fair place to come from.

&gt;I don’t know how space privacy laws work lol

Honestly there aren't many laws for this space as of now. It's so new the book is pretty much being a few steps behind what's happening. NASA would be able to use anything publicly available so as long as it's public they don't need any special deals or treatment. I'm not sure what data you're referring to exactly but if someone would get first pick of being worked with NASA is almost certainly high on any list when it comes to data.

If you're talking about NASA using Starlink in general then certainly. The US military is likely going to be a huge consumer for them so they already have a government organization on board and SpaceX has a pretty close relationship with NASA so if anything they'd get preferential treatment from SpaceX. It's arguably the most important relationship that SpaceX has.",1
"Imo it’s no different to a building blocking the view of the lake or mountains from your house.

Just have to find a different way to view it. Its inevitable that the sky will only get busier.

I can see many advantages for having multiple satellites, could nasa use them somehow for data too?

"&gt; Personally I think some fraction of the satellites on starlink should host space telescopes, or SpaceX should launch some number of space telescopes to toss a bone to astronomers.

Attaching telescopes really doesn't seem feasible especially with their size and low orbit. But what if they marked a percent of their profits or revenue specifically to fund space telescopes?

&gt;keep the sky clean than consider the benefits of providing internet worldwide.

It also tends to ignore the lack of power astronomers have. Even if they were able to convince one government to stop the project there is no stopping everyone. You only delay it.",1

"**Thirty Meter Telescope**

The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large telescope (ELT) that has become controversial due to its planned location on Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawaii, a mountain which is considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The TMT would become the largest visible-light telescope on Mauna Kea.Scientists have been considering ELTs since the mid 1980s. In 2000, astronomers considered the possibility of a telescope with a light-gathering mirror larger than 20 meters in diameter. The technology to build a mirror larger than 8.4 meters does not exist; instead scientists considered using either small segments that create one large mirror, or a grouping of larger 8-meter mirrors working as one unit.

"&gt; helping the world by selling them expensive internet service they won't be able to afford.

1- There is no price yet.

2- [This conversation with Gwynne Shotwell](https://spacenews.com/spacex-plans-to-start-offering-starlink-broadband-services-in-2020/) SpaceX's president is the most we currently have to go on. Since the beginning the aim as been rural, under served, and the developing world. Having expensive costs won't get you anywhere with those demographics. Though I believe Hughes net the current satellite internet provider is over $200 a month for really awful internet since it's in GSO

&gt;The price point is also being studied. Shotwell said millions of people in the U.S. pay $80 per month to get “crappy service.” She didn’t say whether Starlink will cost more or less than $80 per month but suggested that would be a segment of the public the company would target as well as rural areas that currently have no connectivity.

So you have no basis for claiming it to be unaffordable.

&gt;even if modern ground based telescopes are generally far more capable than space telescopes

That doesn't mean that will always be true. Launching has always been expensive which helps lead to any satellite being expensive. Not the only factor but it's a major one. It's cheaper to launch than ever and it's also arguably easier to build a satellite than ever. There are multiple companies out there working on satellite buses to provide power and propulsion so they can use that as the foundation and focus on their science /objective. 

I'm not well versed in the quality of ground telescopes but I do know that regardless of Starlink there are many downsides to them. Weather and day night both being constant. You also have limited locations and get to deal with lovely things like what's happening in Hawaii. You don't have that in space. Given the funding there is no doubt many if not all types of telescopes can be better in space. For one thing they can be bigger. We're at a point where, especially if Starship hits remotely any of it's goals, we could assemble a space telescope larger than anything possible on the ground. Not to mention building constellations even if they're ""cheaper"" satellites but covering a wide area. Imagine the effective lens that we can create with anything like those satellites. That's some amazing science. Why would you not want that?

Ground based ones that are good have money put into them. The [Thirty Meter Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Meter_Telescope) is over 1 billion. For that money we could have space telescopes doing plenty of science just as well I'd wager. Certainly more than it is with the stopped construction. The James Webb is over 1 billion as well so there is still plenty of lessons to be learned other than throw money at it. I feel there is a good argument for smaller more affordable telescopes built in numbers. Also if private groups not just governments build them it won't be the same as where we are today. I'd love to see a comparison of investment into space telescopes vs ground telescopes overall. Especially those open to the wider use.",1
"Personally I think some fraction of the satellites on starlink should host space telescopes, or SpaceX should launch some number of space telescopes to toss a bone to astronomers.

Outside of that I think astronomers' complaints come off as selfish and like the whole astronomy community would rather keep the sky clean than consider the benefits of providing internet worldwide.

Also, if you're doing ground-based astronomy you're already calibrating for *so much*. I don't see why it's such a big deal to just add one more calibration step. mask the pixels where there's a satellite. It's not like the satellites are fixed relative to the stars, so you can still take data, you'll just have to throw out a few parts of each frame...",1
Bad.,1
"&gt; the OP--that's basically ""I don't do ground based astronomy so I don't give a shit.""

I never said I don't give a shit. I know people rarely do directly say it and you are also clearly talking about more than just me but still. I do care but really what are the options? Delays? You read at least some of my comment, I felt I made it clear that it seems to be an inevitability. Even if the US manages to stop any US company from doing it that's only going to delay it happening. Astronomers don't have power. It's short sighted to act like this isn't going to happen sooner or later.

&gt;relatively low cost solutions to minimize the impact

What exactly?

&gt;There are ways for private companies to put satellites into orbit AND play nice with others

SpaceX seems to be the only ones that give a shit. So how is hindering them doing anything for the cause of trying to give us the best sky for the circumstances? 

---

&gt;As it is, I am guaranteed to see at least one satellite a night through my eye piece

I want this to be considered separate if at all possible. This is not trying to be argumentative but I'm genuinely curious. 

Is that such a bad thing? Is a world where you can regularly see satellites during viewings so awful?

Through an eye piece you'd see it for how long? Especially in conjunction with viewing time. Even seeing multiple per night in overall time you spent viewing for any event it'd be less than 1% if not .1%. Do you feel that seeing a satellite in some way contaminates the viewing experience? Even if it's for seconds.",1
"Don't forget the massive cult of St. Elon Who Can Do No Wrong, helping the world by selling them expensive internet service they won't be able to afford.

But hey, if you know absolutely nothing about astronomy ""replace everything with space telescopes"" sounds like a great idea, even if modern ground based telescopes are generally far more capable than space telescopes.",1
"It's too bad that millions of people--amateur astronomers and astrophotographers--will be negatively impacted by satellite pollution where there are vial, relatively low cost solutions to minimize the impact.

As it is, I am guaranteed to see at least one satellite a night through my eye piece. 

There are ways for private companies to put satellites into orbit *AND* play nice with others. But private companies and the captured governments don't give a shit.

What's truly frustrating are those people--and there is at least one other replay to the OP--that's basically ""I don't do ground based astronomy so I don't give a shit."" Figuratively, not looking past ones own self-centered nose.",1
"I'm bias as I love SpaceX and what they're doing. I also don't personally do ground based astronomy.

I think that attacking Starlink is a horrible idea for astronomy. I don't think that you can stop mega constellations only delay them. Even if you killed Starlink there are other in the pipe and even if you made it illegal in the US other countries like China will out them up eventually. 

I'd say we're lucky that SpaceX is getting to this space first, essentially, (One Web did have a single batch but before but that's all they have) Elon and SpaceX have made it clear they're going to work and find a way so the satellites hinder ground based astronomy as little as possible. It will take time to figure out but they have started.

Now imagine that Amazon's constellation gets up first or China's. Do you think that they would care or even acknowledge the problem? I seriously doubt they'd do much more than say ""sorry, not sorry"". If SpaceX can find something that works it can hopefully become a standard. Something that the other followers will have to match or copy which makes it increasingly likely that any further followers will also match or copy it even if they aren't bound by the US's laws like other countries.

So all in all I think that for the coming future and possibilities for the sky, we're in one of the best possible starting positions. Trying to hinder that because you don't like the direction the world is going in regards to space is foolish. Even if you are able to effectively kill it in the US, you're still only delaying it.

With SpaceX lowering the cost of getting to space, and aiming to continue lowering it, we could see a shift towards less ground telescopes and an increase of space based ones. No day night cycles :D Though I am not well versed in any advantages of ground based ones it does seem like radio telescopes shouldn't be effected by the luminosity of the constellations so there is that. None of that even touches on the positives that Starlink will give us. Just the inevitability of how the sky will change.",1
"I think starlink will allow people to have connections to internet without a government censoring it.

As far as the streaks across the sky, they will need to remove them somehow or spend some more money for space telescopes.

Imo Elon musk has done more in his lifetime and at a fraction of the cost then many governments have done over the last 30-40 years.

Some pain points now but it will get resolved.",1

Nothing quite like the night sky in Colorado, way outside the city limits, in a hot tub.",1
is Eta Carina in there someplace?,1
Fantastic!,1
That's clearly a penis.,1
This is wonderful,1
Depends on how long is too long. Ft. Griffin is rather nice at about 2hr west of town. Dinosaur Valley in Glen Rose has a nice southern sky. The northern sky there is a bit of a wash in the NE due to the Comanche Peak nuke plant. I used to observe from Meridian State Park routinely which is about 1.5hrs south of town.,1

It had to be done eventually, so here it is! The Eta Carinae Nebula! Being the biggest and brightest nebula, it always killed me to know that it was only visible in the Southern Hemisphere. What a treat this nebula is some absolutely fantastic structure throughout it in the form of HH objects, bok globules, dust pillars, etc.

Just such an interesting area that many people either don't know about or will never see just because of it being located in the southern hemisphere. Also, to preemptively answer any questions about what true color means [I have a really big post on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/afdeyz/i_made_an_animation_showing_the_differences/edxnfpa/).",1

This is fucking sick,1
Thanks for sharing this. I'd like to see more of the sun on this sub! Beautiful.,1
"Yeah, that is hilarious .....

**Astrophotographer:** *Hey guys look at this picture I took of a planet 3 billion kilometers away, using only my own personal equipment and my own expertise and knowledge, isn't it amazing?* 

**Public:** *Meh? Yeah that's neat .... oh look cat pictures.* 

**Astrophotographer:** *It's of Uranus* 

**Public:** *Uranus! ... Why didn't you say so. .... Hey guys look! It's a picture of Uranus! Let me get my anus/anal/rectum comedy cheat sheet and have some fun here .... Uranus, why didn't you say that in the first place!?* 

= = = = = = 

**Sidenote:** that is an amazing image to capture using backyard equipment and processing on your own. Even 20 years ago, you would have been considered a millionaire genius to have been able to do this. 30 years ago and your image would have been featured in national magazines.",1
Looks exactly like a Van Gough sunflower,1
Can we just rename it already?,1
How much does a filter cost,1
**4 h 25 min 30 s** Total exposure time time if anyone is wondering,1

Do you think bresser can do it ? If not then what scope to you recommend ?",1
"I used the Baader Hyperion zoom Mark IV (on 8mm) and barlow (2.25x). With the scopes focal length of 800mm it should work out to be 225x. But then I cropped and zoomed the image in photoshop, so this looks bigger than what it would be visually. Using my shortest focal length/highest magnification eyepiece (2.3mm), I get up to 347x. And as nice as that sounds, don't expect that to be sharp. It does show off the colour of planets like this in visual, though.",1
"It's great for visual observation as well! I don't think it's meant for photography, and I'm sure other scopes would be better suited, but overall, I'm impressed with its performance so far.",1
Wait so does it mean that with a regular home telescope you can see the sun with your bare eyes with this level of detail?,1
"Brother you are great but it's Uranus

A dedicated solar telescope that blocks out most of the light before it hits the camera sensor,1
"WNH stars are most likely massive main sequence stars still undergoing core hydrogen burning, and are therefore distinct from H-poor WR stars. The appearance of heavy elements in their spectra is down to two factors. Their high mass produces a large convective core that leaves behind processed material as it retreats. At the same time their extreme luminosities drive strong winds and consequently high mass loss on the main sequence, exposing the processed material before hydrogen burning terminates; rotation may also mix some of this material into the radiative envelope. These strong winds are also responsible for the broad emission lines characteristic of WR stars.",1
"My question might sound stupid, i know nothing about telescopes and all... And I have a hard time translating mt question.

If we project the equator out into the sky (see [here](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Equatorial+Coordinate+System) for a diagram), then we can use the distance around this ""celestial equator"" as a coordinate, this is what we call right ascension. We need a zero point for this, so we use the vernal (march) equinox. This is the point where the sun passes directly over the equator in march (the sun also passes directly over the equator in September-the autumnal equinox).

The measurement for right ascension then starts at this point and follows the equator towards the east.

Declination is just how far it is from the equator following the path from equator to pole. So for example, the North star would have a declination of 90°.",1

Great shot man! Well done.,1
I appologize.  But as a non-astronomer that didnt really make sense to me. Angle of what from the equator?,1
The short video loop is kind of jarring with the way it just suddenly snaps back to the beginning. Have you considered doing one of those loop effects where the frames reverse at the end so that there is a smooth transition?,1
are you now able to do anything extraordinary? whats in my left front jeans pocket?,1
"I think you're confusing two things here. The star sequence (O-B-A-F-G-F-M) is just the categories that most stars fall into, this is by no means an exhausted list of the types of stars out there. R136a1 is an example of one of these stars that fall outside that range, with the WR spectral type indicating this is not a common type of star and therefore cannot be classified by this system (well technically it can but this would be an accurate portrait of the star). 

The same happens at the other end of the spectrum with M-dwarfs having a wide range of properties and then even smaller L and T dwarfs having very strange properties (and in fact making the transition from star to gas giant planet a very fuzzy one indeed). 

Stars at both extremes are not well understood as they're either difficult to find or rare (they also behave so differently from our Sun that we have little in the was of a physical basis to being modelling them). Another huge consideration is the metallically of stars, this can affect their lifetime (as well as magnetic fields!).

TLDR: It's really complicated, there are no clear cuts in stellar mass and this is a hugely active area of research.",1

"This might sound funny but I've been trying to get a decent image of the Orion Nebula with a planetary camera (ASI 120MCS) for a few months now. I could still capture the nebula but it is very blurry. So, finally I've decided to buy a DSLR in hope that I'll get better deep sky photos. After hooking it up with my small telescope, this was the result. The setup was so much more easier with a DSLR than the CCD I used before this and the pic in my opinion is not that bad.

"The stellar designation system of assigning Greek letters was formalized by Johann Bayer. He used a system of brightness classification that was not as precise as our modern magnitude system. He just had classes like ""first class"", ""second class"" etc. 

Betelgeuse and Rigel are close enough in brightness that he just assigned them both as ""first class"". What he would then do is just go top to bottom (north to south) and assign the greek letters that way. 

So in a constellation he would first rank the stars by their brightness classification. Then for each brightness classification, starting from the northern-most point of the constellation, and going to the southern-most point he would assign the greek letters. Since he lived in the northern hemisphere, that put Betelgeuse on top, and thus it got Alpha while Rigel got Beta.

Had he lived in the southern hemisphere, those designations would have likely been reversed.",1

"**Equatorial coordinate system**

The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects. It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention.The origin at the center of Earth means the coordinates are geocentric, that is, as seen from the centre of Earth as if it were transparent. The fundamental plane and the primary direction mean that the coordinate system, while aligned with Earth's equator and pole, does not rotate with the Earth, but remains relatively fixed against the background stars. A right-handed convention means that coordinates increase northward from and eastward around the fundamental plane.

Sorry I own a dobs and said the wrong thing. It would be the same for a filter between the camera and telescope since it is still behind the lens. I guess it has to do with the size like you pointed out since refractors are smaller then what I am used too.,1
"I'm afraid to ask what you thought it was, lol.   Thanks.",1
Where one has protective filters actually depends on the size of the telescope.  But I'm not familiar with eyepieces because I only use cameras (no eyepieces).,1
"I thought this was something else .... 

Good stuff mate",1
Is it safe to use a filter that goes into the eyepiece? I have heard from multiple sources that you should never use one of these and only to use the ones that go on the front of telescope. They say this is because if it is between the camera and focuser then the lens/mirrors in the telescope will heat up and expand which can lead to cracking.,1
"Ill check it out, thanks!",1
I have a specialized Solar Filter called the DayStar Quark between the telescope and the camera.,1

"&gt; What the hell does the source of the money have to do with it? 

Because Decadal Surveys like Astro2020 only really have any sway over US federal funding. The majority of money for TMT will come from outside the US and with the remainder being private money from the Universities of California. Astro2020 has no influence over these. The decadal cannot tell TMT to move, but it could state grant federal funding on the condition TMT moves elsewhere. It's quite unlikely though, as the point of the Decadal Surveys is to rank scientific priorities. 

&gt;Now we'll just let China, Chile and the Canary Islands lead and we will fall behind.

China is a member of TMT, the US government is not. TMT is an international observatory.

The real bad news for US astronomers would be if there is no federal investment in TMT or GMT. It would mean astronomers outside the limited number of partner institutions would have no right to apply for time on either. Their best chance would actually be applying for the European ELT. It would also mean TMT and GMT continue cash starved, in which case their capabilities and science will be reduced for years. Federal funding is more important than where TMT is built, without it only US astronomers in UC (and maybe UH) institutions will have access.",1

"The subject is *not* looking at cool objects through telescopes. If your course is going to teach you useful skills in astronomy, it is going to teach you about the optical properties of telescopes, the characteristics of black body spectra, and the geometry of finding things on the sky. It is heavy on math. For a high school level, it can still be made pretty easy. Know how to follow a formula and do trigonometry.",1
Dude that looks amazing,1
"\&gt;  They want Astro2020 to ensure that no federal money is used to build on  state land without the consent of local Indigenous people.

What the hell does the source of the money have to do with it?  That just sounds like another posture to block the building of the telescope.

I just find it troubling that here is a perfect example of religion standing in the way of science and there being wide spread support of blocking the science.  If would be different if this land was a tribal reservation, but it's been the state's land for a long time.  The indigenous people should have worked to make this land a tribal reserve a long time ago if it was truly a religious location for them.

If we lose this, the USA loses more in science.  It was nice when we were a leading frontier.  Now we'll just let China, Chile and the Canary Islands lead and we will fall behind.",1

"I understand the point you’re making.

Before getting a *proper* job (/s) I was researching x-ray binary stars. I needed to understand the physics of stars, and needed good maths ability etc, but also needed supplementary skills: I needed to process large datasets and that meant decent competence in using analytical software, I also taught myself to code so I could create my own software to do the analysis I needed. 

A lot of (pretty much all) observational astro work depends on using observations in electromagnetic spectrum to test theories about things that are so far away there is no other way to figure stuff out. That means you need to understand the physics behind emission/absorption lines in spectra and deduce what they mean.

In my research group we also had a team who worked on astro instruments - e.g. designing/building the x-ray telescopes that get put up on satellites. Those guys needed to understand the astrophysics behind the need for the instruments, and needed the engineering skills for the design/build work. 

If you’re doing planetary astro work, you will need geological knowledge. 

So, yeah, it’s a “broad church”, there’s a common foundation of decent maths, knowledge of physics and wider relevant science, and experimental technique. After that there is specialist knowledge needed for the sub-field you’re in. 

It’s also common to collaborate, so you need to be the world expert in every single topic.",1

"The flaming star nebula, tadpoles, spider and more


Check out [my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/gorilla_astro/) for more astrophotos and space facts


Rippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name. The red and blue colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes. The bright star AE Aurigae is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas. When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted. The blue region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively. The Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as IC 405, lies about 1500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of Auriga. One and a half degree East from the Flaming Star Nebula is located IC 410, a region of faint nebulosity surrounding the open star cluster NGC 1893. The cluster itself is small and located just below center, underneath the central dust region of the nebula. This nebula contains complex wisps of gas and is a beautiful target for astrophotography

Your CDA query looks reasonable from just a first-pass standpoint, but I haven't actually used CDA.

If you want to download the data, you'll probably end up with .FITS files. The only program I know of that does a decent job reading those is SAOimage DS9, but its user interface is awful.

Best of luck!",1

"I believe that catching photons is really the easy part. However, putting a photon (or photons) into a spatial context to derive an image would be a huge challenge. If I recall correctly, there is even a physical limit imposed by the optical wavelengths so that, even with the ""ideal"" telescope, it would be impossible to achieve a resolution anywhere near what is needed for identifying aliens. Just think back how ""blurry"" the best pictures of Jupiter have been, taken by optical telescopes, and only the space probe Juno specifically sent to orbit Jupiter was able to deliver those fanastic images we know today. (Oh, ok, if the aliens in the Andromeda galaxy have the size of a sphere with a radius of a couple of billions miles, well, then perhaps we might be able to identify them on day :-) ) Cheers!",1

"You can actually calculate how many stars will have died in 10^(6) years in Andromeda.  Andromeda is a typical L* galaxy with an average [supernova rate of about 10^(-2) year^(-1)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984A%26A...140..431B/abstract) which puts us at about 10^(4) supernovae before the light from Andromeda reaches us.  The Andromeda galaxy has about 10^(12) stars so that represents 10^(-8) of the total stars in the Andromeda Galaxy or 1 in 100 million.  So for any given star in the galaxy, there is about a 1 in 100 million chance it will not be there in 10^(6) years.  Considering there are about 10^(6) pixels in this image, that accounts for about a 1/100th variation in the pixels of the above image.  So only accounting for which stars still exist and not other external structure altering effects, you'll notice a brightness variation of about 1% in the image after 10^(6) years which is below the background noise of this image, so it would be imperceptible.",1

Further, population density at latitudes can push a deduction towards one country as most likely.  I have no idea if I am correct, just possibly correct.",1

"Visible yes, but without color. The only things humans can see color on in the night sky is planets and stars. Our eyes are not sensitive enough to detect color on nebula (except a little green on the core of the Orion nebula).

However, the leading theories at the time would tell us that there's  more planets than there are stars in the galaxy. And on a side note, Andromeda has up to 1 trillion stars, which means that this is just the upper limit that scientists estimate.",1
"I mean, technically yes, if only in the sense that the light is ~2.5 million years old and thus we can't actually observe the present state of Andromeda. However, the idea that an entire galaxy can be destroyed is a bit out there. What I mean is that there is no observed phenomenon that can disappear an entire galaxy, especially in as short of a time as 2.5 million years.",1
That’s an amazing shot. Looking at it just humbles me.,1

"If you look at Andromeda through a telescope it barely just looks like a little poof ball.  Very faint.  Your eyes are really good at seeing what is happening like...

But cameras are really good at adding up photons and displaying them, that's how this picture is possible.",1
"Great photo.  It is magnificent to see the Moon in a telescope.  Just wait though, until you first see Saturn.  As for ""planet season"", it is always planet season.  As you mentioned in the thread, Venus is visible at present.  Plenty of other things to look for too.  You've seen the Orion Nebula, but try to find the Witchhead Nebula.  It is very near Rigel, the very bright star at the bottom right of Orion.",1
"""our"" (not ""are"") sun and solar system were probably created by some star that went nova.  It could not have become a black hole because we are here (and we would not be if it became a black hole).

However, there is no way to know which star kicked it off.

This was 4.6 billion years ago... and there was a large patch of gas and dust and the death of some star probably triggered the reaction that caused the gravitational collapse of the dust and gas to form our sun and solar system.

We are not the product directly of that star, but the product of the reaction that stars death caused in the nearby material.

There is no way to know what star it was (or even if it was a star that started the event, though this is the leading hypothesis) - as it was 4.6 billion years ago.",1

"I too was going to ask about his colour calibration method, as the milky way stars look about like I'd expect but andromeda galaxy looks very magenta to my eye.

As to your specific question - there are many methods, if pursuing ""true"" colour one can refer to known stars in the frame, colour of which is known and just adjust to match those values. Results that I've had with this method have not been very pleasing aesthetically, and as I'm not making images for any research or documentary purpose I usually just ""make it look nice"".

What exactly is a Nebula? I'm an astronomy newbie,1
"The first telescope I ever purchased was a  dobsonion telescope and after seeing the planets through it, I immediately wanted to take pictures of them.

The only problem was that at the time I knew nothing about astrophotography and the only camera that I had was my phone.

At r/askastrophotography one of the most common questions I see is how to get started taking pictures of the moon and the planets.

This was taken through a Skywatcher dobsonion telescope, with my iPhone X, a cheap cell phone adapter, held up to a 6mm goldeline eyepiece (~$30 USD).

Typically astrophotography involves long exposure times and image processing with computer software.

This is one single frame, no stacking, no tracking. The only editing that I did was through the native iPhone app for color, contrast, etc.

I thought I’d post this to show what can be done with minimal experience and modest equipment by astrophotography standards.",1
"Wow. This is really, really pretty. And it’s just amazing how there are so many stars considering what exactly they are.....incredible.",1
Right. It looks like a gray smudge.,1

"Damn dude, really nice photo especially considering the equipment you’re working with.

I’m going to go against the grain here and say that I think you hit the black point a little too hard in processing. 

Light pollution sucks and sometimes you’re forced to darken the image to get rid of it, I get it. I think if you work on your processing skills you will learn little tricks to process it out without having to up the black point.

Pixinsight is amazing but cost prohibitive for most people. I’m really intrigued by “Astro pixel processor”, it’s not super cheap but you can get a free 30 day trial. It seems way more intuitive than pixinsight. If you get a 1 year license it breaks down to $5 a month.

I would also HIGHLY recommend an intervalometer. That sucks you got scammed, but an intervalometer can be ordered directly from amazon for cheap so I wouldn’t worry about that happening in this case.

1) itl save you from freezing 
2) if you’re pressing the shutter release by hand there is a chance that you’re causing some camera shake, even if it’s on a delay",1

"Hey there guys, as a current employee (Though not for much longer) I can answer a few questions 

Firstly, we don't ship outside of Australia and New Zealand unfortunately. I also don't recommend purchasing a telescope online as they are often damaged in transit.

Also, yeah, don't buy online from us, as we can't garauntee you will receive orders. They are making the tiny store teams deal with all the web orders and often stock is wrong or things get lost in transit and then we cop the abuse.",1

You will need Calculus to follow either of those tracks.  If you look up requirements for those degrees they should specify that you need calculus.,1
The physics with calc track should be required if you’re a physics major. You should also have to take Calc1-3 with Diff Eq at the minimum. These classes will make the math and understanding higher level physics SO much easier. Take Calc route,1

Do you do only rings, or other pieces like pendants, etc. as well?",1
Completely self-taught. Reading jewelry books and YouTube videos are two things that helped me get started.  Getting hands-on and learning from my mistakes were my best lessons.,1
Yeah I can do this in white gold.  I actually just got some purple glow powder also so we can make that happen. I would need to know the size to give a accurate price for that.,1

"I dont know how old you are or where you live but in my country at the age of 14(considering you spent 1 year per class level) you can recieve money if you have good grades and they go directly to bank account so you can buy stuff, you should check if thats possible for you",1

No problem! I'm glad you enjoy it!,1
"They could be parametrised by diameter easily, you'd just replace each R with 0.5D, and you'd end up with a constant like 0.25 or 0.5 (depending on power of R in original equation)  in front of all equations. But that's not nice.",1
"I did physics and astrophysics right the way through to PhD before I decided I didnt want that career.  I've had SO MANY interesting jobs since, I could live life twice over and still be excited for whats left to do.

"I have wondered the same thing.

Similarly I have wondered why the circumference of a circle is given as 2πr, when πd is so much simpler.",1
"If they are comparing the linear dimensions, they could use either, but out of convention everyone has memorized the surface area and volume of a sphere and circumference of a circle in terms of radius (4/3 π r³ and 4 π r² and 2 π r and so on) so it is easier to talk in terms of radii.",1
It's just a convention really. Please note that the size would not change as you mentioned. A star that is 30 solar radii in radius is also 30 solar diameters in diameter 😉 so it really doesn't make a difference,1
**I gotta get one of those**,1

"Hi! I’m the astronomer who wrote that linked post. To answer your practical question about McGill, there are some awesome astronomers in the McGill physics department- most notably, Vicky Kaspi and her group are absolutely killing it right now with all their CHIME/FRB research (like, they were noted as one of the top groups of 2019 in all of science right now by Nature). So I’m betting that’s the department you want, or at minimum you want to go find out who the undergrad adviser is in physics and schedule a meeting with them- the department should have a prof in charge of this. That person will be able to give you heaps of advice on McGill specifically, and have enough knowledge of all the majors to help you choose the right one for your interests. 

I mean, keep in mind these days astronomy is all physics just on a universal scale for our laboratory. Plenty of astronomers have a physics BSc (I do!), but if your passion lies in, say, astrochemistry you might want to do the physics and chem degree. Hope that makes sense. 

Good luck!",1

"For this nebula, you actually want to go lower mag, brighter view, and wider field of view. It's a BIG nebula. The grey smudge you saw was only the core. I recommend looking at it again without the barlow.

Here's a sketch of it: http://www.deepskywatch.com/images/sketches/M-42-orion-nebula-sketch.jpg

You can see the four stars in the brighter core, but there's a whole bunch of nebulosity in that area to see.

I also recommend getting a couple pieces of equipment to really bring out the nebula (and other nebulae, like the Veil Nebula, M8, M20 etc)

1. [Get a 32mm GSO Plossl.](https://agenaastro.com/gso-32mm-plossl-eyepiece.html). Not expensive, and will give you a brighter view, and a wider true field of view than the 25mm plossl.

2. [Get a good quality O-III filter](https://agenaastro.com/televue-band-mate-1-25-oxygen-iii-filter-b2o-0125.html). Don't cheap out on these, the premium ones are worth it!

If you *really* want to see more, then you can upgrade to a 2"" eyepiece and filter:

1. [30mm GSO Superview (2"")](https://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html). This gives an even wider true field of view and wider apparent field of view than the 32mm Plossl.

2. 2"" O-III filter. The downside is the cost gets much higher - goes up to $200. If you wanted to still get a good filter that won't break the bank, [the 2"" Orion Ultrablock](https://www.telescope.com/2-Orion-UltraBlock-Narrowband-Eyepiece-Filter/p/5657.uts) is a great value at just $89. It's not as good as a quality O-III, but it will definitely enhance the nebula quite bit.

Either of those combinations of gear will really show a lot more of the nebula.",1
Anytime! I recommend you also to download an app called Skymap on your phone. It will help you big time in identifying night sky objects.,1

"Most of the stars don't have enough mass to go supernova at the end of their lives. When they run out of hydrogen to fuse at the core, they contract until the core gets hot enough to fuse helium and after that, making a long story short (very short), they expand and shed their outer layers to space in what it's called a planetary nebula (it doesn't really have to do with planets at all, they're just called like that because in the early days they looked sort of like a planet through the telescope).

" 

""The way that *deep space* astrophotography works is that you have a motorized equatorial mount aligned with how the Earth rotates. The mount is able to track any object in the night sky. Many long exposure images are taken, and combined using a method called image stacking, which significantly improves the quality of the final image.

Most astrophotographers use a monochrome camera because it gives them flexibility in recording the specific type of light they want.

In *some* pictures, special filters are used that isolate the very specific wavelength of light that gets emitted by various ionized gases. The most common filters are hydrogen, sulphur, and oxygen. Each gas gets mapped to either red, green, or blue. The end result is a false colour picture that has a large amount of contrast.

True colour photos are shot using regular red, green, and blue filters, or by using a normal colour camera.

The images can be taken over one night or several, it doesn’t matter. The more *total* exposure time you have, the better quality the final image will be. This is why people spend tens of hours on a single image, to get a better result. It gets much more in-depth than this, but that’s a basic overview of how people do this type of astrophotography (deep space astrophotography).""",1

"I saw one of those strings of satellites; it was so weird to see satellites in formation that I now know what it is like to see a UFO.  Freakish.  And bright, very bright in a dark sky.  

20 years ago I would have believed Elon Musk of I had heard that he was going to provide low-cost Internet to the hinterlands, but he seems to be getting a lot more full of himself.  Thar was that whole ""pedo guy"" spat in 2018 and he has this series of tunnel and hyperloop projects in California that I also know he talks of as being something that would help the masses, but they are massively expensive, so unless he has some kind of scheme for providing a quota of cheap tickets, it will never work, and the same thing would have to be done with the Starlink constellation, OR he would have to break with the current trend and actually try to run this without management taking 80% of the profits, like most people do.

What I'm getting at here is that if he really were going to do these noble things it might be worse the eyesore and astronomy issues, but how much do I trust this guy these days?  Not much.  If Musk wanted to be SUPER God-blessed-me famous he would use his megabucks to develop a truly black solar panel that was 30% efficient or something, and cover the things with that and fix two problems at once, and then make black cars that could partly recharge just by being out in the sun.

"You can see some of these things with a good scope and low magnification (which concentrates more light on the retina) but it is nearly impossible to see color, and there is not enough light to make the edges seem crisp like this.  I have seen faint color distinction in M42, the great nebula in Orion, in a 12-inch scope, and I definitely think I can see the difference in colors between the parts of the Trifid Nebula, but that might be an illusion.  In this thing, I was able to recognize the dark triangular obscurement (top of the photo) against what looked like bluish-white light (again, illusory color) and could tell that there was something going on on the other side that I years and years later realized was the Pillars of Creation.",1
This is ridiculously good. We see so many photos from billion dollar satellites and yet this is achievable from ‘amateur’ equipment? Or am I missing something? The reality strikes home when I think ‘imagine if that image was one I created’ . A. Maze. Ing.,1

"You can do it for a fraction of that price with frugal choices and an acceptance of the compromises you will be making.    IMO starting with basic gear is important to learning the process and, truthfully, great results can be had.",1
It can be done for less but it wont look as nice as this one...,1
"It would immediately explode then rapidly burn up, hitting the air at that speed is no different than hitting something solid. Truth is it could never get as low as a low flying plane. It would burn up much higher first.",1
It would burn up like a small meteoroid.,1
Any 750kg object traveling through the atmosphere at 35k mph will make quite a show.,1
Thanks.  The main pieces of kit are listed in my top level comment,1
"4 light years tall   


das a big",1
"For imaging deep sky objects, I've concluded that amateur apparently starts at a $3000 price tag. Below that I guess doesn't qualify as even trying.",1
"beautiful.  
what equipment do you use? one day i want to take photos like this",1
"&gt;I don't know if this is allowed here.

The easiest way to find out would be to read the sub rules, which would tell you to go read the sticky at r/telescopes.",1
[This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WSG0MnmUsEY) video details the relation between regular color and false color in space,1
"In astrophotography, distance matters little compared to luminosity. Long exposure allows cameras to make sum total images of all the photons hitting the sensor, which our eyes do not. I've taken photos of this nebula using a telescope roughly the size of my forearm",1
Lol that reminds me of when someone said they found the picture of the Moon that a drawing plagiarized. Best part was that the drawing was clearly not of our moon.,1
There is some recent doubt in this idea of them being destroyed btw. I'm not knowledgeable enough to intelligently describe the reasons for doubt though,1
"It is suspected to start brightning up around mid to late january, if it keeps dimming after that you will have better luck asking a magic 8-ball what would happen",1
"This is mind blowing. How TF can you see this from earth at 7000 light years away. I'm fairly certain this is impossible, as the Hubble itself struggles and that bitch up above the earth and doesn't have to struggle with the atmosphere. Its no luvoir, but this is beautiful.  I'm just trying to wrap my head around how you can possibly see this with non government grade space viewing technology.",1
I am uh .... Blown away ??!!!,1
This is a GREAT pic ! 🤗🤗🤗🤗,1
"Well, are you spying on me?   Lol. Exactly!",1
"Thanks I has always wondered with DSOs what the eyes see,so you just set up your scope,pick your target and chill with some beers while it does the work?",1
Me ... My scope?  Probably absolutely nothing.  The eyes are a terrible instrument for detecting faint detail.   Especially mine.,1
🤷🏽‍♂️,1
So what would your eyes see if you were to look into your scope?,1
Extremely difficult to see visually.,1
"Ya I knew it was something to do with the gases. That's so cool man, that's probably such a satisfying hobby or past time. About 5 years ago I was so close to buying a telescope but I am dumb as nails and I figured I'd never be able to set it up to see anything worthwhile 

Awesome shot though man, that's awesome.",1
Ha... well it is visible in a normal telescope with enough capability.  But here I have shot through filters that isolate the light emissions of particular gasses and I have mapped them to specific colors to make an interesting picture.,1
Appreciate it,1
"It is suspected that these have been wiped out, but I suppose we will never know in our lifetime.   Thanks !",1
"Can someone explain this to me please. What you're seeing in this picture isnt visible to just a normal telescope right? As in, its done using different filters to see different types of light... right? Lol honestly I have no clue if what I said was right but god damn do I LOVE ASTRONOMY!!",1
Damn that's awesome. Looks like an artists rendering,1
Awesome work. It still baffles me to think that we are able to see something 4 light years tall on a small screen. Also these pillars have already been blown away by a supernova. In a way we're documenting the history of our galaxy.,1
Thank you !,1
Well done.,1
I think I will do both with different telescopes but start taking pics later. This is interesting.,1
"Thanks so much. It’s a fantastic area of the sky, no wonder it gets so much photographic love",1
I tried and didn’t last long with visual astronomy.  I love taking pics.,1
"Ya know, at first i thought this looked a bit like a repost, but then i realized “ oh yeah, this is a thing that exists that people can take pictures of and OP did a really good job”",1
"This can be very nice. Indeed, I attend to buy a 12"" Dob for my birthday to be able to see nice things. But maybe after I'll buy a newton with Goto System to take photos.",1
Tilt shifting makes everything look cool,1
Starting is easier than you may think.  This stuff gets more accessible all the time.,1
Appreciate that,1
Haha. Yeah well it all starts with humble beginnings.  My first shot of this... was probably lower than base-level amateur.,1
I wish that one day I will have a nice little setup to make astrophotography.,1
TIL there are levels to 'amateur'.  This is fantastic work.,1
"Light and distance still amaze my mind.  Even though I understand it, I am amazed buy the scale.",1
Interesting. Well... this is how I will always know them.,1
Thanks so much. It is in the same style for colorization.,1
Anytime :),1
God this is beautiful O\_O Looks Like a Hubble photo,1
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10925-pillars-of-creation-destroyed-by-supernova/,1
That is actually a very good idea. I will try it next clear night. Thank you for your kindness!,1
"Will do! Also, have you tried to only insert the eyepiece halfway? Like, don't use the extension and insert the eyepiece but make sure some of the silver is still showing, kind of like it does when you insert it in the extension tube. 

If you do that, just make sure the screws are tight and the eyepiece is secure so it doesn't fall out. It may get you that extra distance out that you need.",1
Thank you very much! Please be kind and return with an answear after you try it out!,1
That is astonishingly beautiful - you did well.,1
"M16 - The Eagle Nebula

Popularized by the famous Hubble Space Telescope image, here are the Pillars of Creation with a wider view of the surroundings.

About 7000 light years distant, the pillars themselves in the middle are about 4-5 light years tall.   These formations were sculpted by stellar winds and gravity, then ionized to glow brightly by extreme radiation of the nearby stars.   This image showcases clouds of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. 

I captured this image with a telescope riding on a tracking mount to keep the target centered in the view.   I then took hundreds of photographs through specialized narrowband filters to isolate the elements.   It is mapped to a false color palette.  The true color of the nebula is a very monotone deep red.

As always, enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!

"I'm not sure... I tried mine and there definitely is a little silver still showing on the eyepiece. There's no way it can go in more, it's being stopped by a ""lip"" in the extension tube. So without the extension, it needs to go out more, but with the extension it needs to go in more... Hmmmm.... 

The only thing I can think of is to make sure you've collimated the scope well, and make sure the extension tube is all the way in. Until we get some clear skies I won't be able to try it out and confirm the same problem.",1
"Great picture, really made it feel «3D»",1

"He’s 5,000 candles in the wind 😢",1
I wonder if it would still look good if somehow the focus could be done accurately...,1
"Thanks, cool picture though!",1
"Yes it came with that one. But it is the same lenght as the focus tube extended all the way and my eyepiece won't go all the way in the extender. There will be like 1 cm space till the end of that silver thing on the eyepiece. Without the extender, i feel like I need to extend the focus tube 1 mm more, but it already reached its limit. When I put the extender on, i put the focus tube all the way in and I feel like I need to go a little more in , but it reached its limit. Do you know what the problem is?",1
"It's heavily post-processed image to give a visual delusion.
Don't be misled technically or astronomically :)",1
You are correct. The true distances to the stars in the image are not reflected in the tilt shift.  The effect is purely aesthetic.,1
"I still haven't tried it yet, but did yours come with an extension tube? Mine did, and I'm almost positive that using the extension will help with your problem.",1
"I can kinda see it if I try really hard. I find it really interesting how we all see slightly, or even very different things",1
"It's a very pretty picture and an interesting effect, nice one :) But am I right in think it's technically misleading, in the sense that the stars are not really arranged in that way (with the ones lower in the picture being closer to us and the higher ones further away)?",1
"&gt; Jupiter, for example, rotates really fast!

And it's huge: these combined effects make an object on the equator on Earth rotate at 1,700 km/h, on Jupiter at 44,000.",1
Wow.,1
"The accretion disk around the black hole gets very hot, easily hot enough to ionize matter by stripping off electrons. I don't know if any nuclear reactions go on in there too, but it wouldn't surprise me.",1
"That’s what I also see when I train myself. Like a side profile of a horses head. 

But as a kid I saw the side face as an arm and then there’s a small gap on the right side of the “body” from the other arm and it looks like a headless person walking lol I see the headless person before I see the horses head because of my first impression as a kid",1

"M51 – The Whirlpool Galaxy and its companion galaxy NGC 5195

Captured on the 10th of January, I got less data on this target than I wanted (clouds rolled in). The final image is the result of a mere 36 minutes of data, so I’ll be revisiting this target to add more exposures at a later date. Still, I’m quite pleased with the result. You can barely make out some more galaxies in the distance: IC 4263, NGC 5169 and NGC 5173, all in the lower right quarter of the image. This is the reason I decided not to crop this tighter.

Nice! You’ll see more detail when the moon is not full and washed out. Good luck!,1
I like it.,1
I took the picture at an angle from the telescope with my iPhone so that’s why it’s a bit distorted and cut off. It was quite cloudy in nj and the clouds were moving in front of the moon so I didn’t have too much time to take the picture lol.,1
And would debris strike Earth..?,1
I wonder what the cloud would look like and act without wind and atmosphere. Would it hang for sometime or drift of into space...,1
Right?,1

You can get started for $1000 USD if you buy a star tracker + vintage lens + used dslr.

It will cost more if you want to do astrophotography with a GoTo equatorial mount.",1
"Thank you :)

I read that too!

One thing to keep in mind, as amazing as it is seeing nebulas and galaxies, they aren't remotely like what you see in pictures. They take super long exposures to capture tons of detail and color that our eyes just can't see. 

It's more of a vague cloud looking thing. It's still amazing to see with your own eyes!",1
"I see... And your a good parent ! This is very hopeful, I know what I am saving for next !
I have been curious to see a nebula up close for a long time now I figure thats a real treat - I think a new planet was discovered by a NASA intern ( I haven't fact checked that ) but I like to believe it!!",1
You forgot to do one of earth.,1
"Honestly, once you get the basics understood, it's really really simple. All you need is someone who's knowledgeable to walk you through the process and you're good (I'm always down to help btw!). My 8 year old was zooming around the skies and found Venus and Orion's nebula!

This was my very first telescope. No experience whatsoever. 

So far I've been able to catch Orion's nebula, Andromeda Galaxy, and some random star clusters. The more I use the telescope, the more I learn the sky and the easier everything gets to find. It's not ""planet season"" yet, but I'm super excited to see Saturn and Jupiter (and hopefully gets some decent pics of them too :)

As far as moon landing places, if you really get to know the moon and it's craters, you'll easily be able to spot the area that they landed (as long as that part of the moon is visible). I haven't tried remembering craters and stuff yet. There's no telescope on Earth that can actually see anything we left there though!",1
"Astronomy as a hobby and professional astronomy are typically very different. Pretty much no professional astronomers actually spend any time at work peering through telescopes.

Astronomy is essentially a part of physics, and physics is applied maths, so to do astronomy you need to develop a strong basis in both. Don't let that put you off too much though, they teach you everything while you're at uni and you won't be alone. If you put the effort in, you'll likely soon find you're better at maths than you think!

"r/askastrophotography

You’ll need very deep pockets to get started  and lots of research - it’s not as simple as attaching a camera to a telescope and pressing the shutter - in fact, most people don’t start with a telescope at all. Expect to spend at least $2000-3000USD on a beginners setup, with at least half of that going to the mount alone.",1
Hey thank you . I would have no idea where to begin since the other thing I read is that you have to do all kinds of research too. You totally gave me some direction here .but anyway this post is about how awesome this is for you! Had you looked through telescopes before? What are you hoping to catch through your lens ?  Can you really find moon landing places?,1
"Honestly, the telescopes that they recommend for ""observing"" instead of actual astrophotography are very simple to use. The ones that are mostly recommended are called Dobsons, or Dobs for short. If you get either a 6"" or 8"" dob, you'll be able to observe super easily and have to ability to take moon and planet photos like me. I have an 8"" dob, and absolutely love it!",1
Holy cow! I have been stargazing for a while and just got  binoculars to try  because I read that they are a huge improvement and the telescope comes with a serious learning curve but this looks incredible and you somehow managed to take a pic! It's awesome !,1
"Get a camera, put it to the lens of your telescope and then you are started. If you don't have a telescope, then direct your camera towards the night sky. It won't catch much, unless it is the Moon or something else very bright, like Venus at present, but it will be a start.",1
Very cool. Tried zooming in on the moon landings. Couldn’t locate them yet.,1
"Thank you for the link.

If I would want to take astronomy as a career path, then I assume certain math fields are essential? The math issue is my main concern, because I’m not the best at it.",1
"Best way is to join an astronomy [club](https://www.astroleague.org/astronomy-clubs-usa-state). If you see yourself doing this only as a hobby, no math or science knowledge is required. Just a love of the sky and the joy of looking up.",1
Any tips on astronomy with binoculars?,1
"Ya, probably.  I suppose its a question whether or not any company would dedicate the computer power to it, but technically i think AI could totally replace people.",1

"I was looking into them. My thought process is, I don't want to just do wide field. I want to really get into nebulas. If I did an eq mount for my camera, I'd have to buy a really good zoom lens. At that point, I'd probably be better off just saving up for a good eq mount and a decent scope to attach the camera to. 

I'm going to do more research into it. I have a while before I can start spending a bunch of money again anyway lol.",1
I have to wear glasses anyways so it’s easy to just wear my prescription sunglasses.,1
These are all amazing. But your shot of mars impressed me the most. I’ve seen great shots of Jupiter abs Saturn before. But hardly ever see a shot of mars with any detail. Was earth and mars particularly close when you took that one?,1
You might also enjoy an equitorial DSLR mount for long exposures from your own camera. Good luck!,1
"I love how Mercury, Venus, and Mars are all closer to Earth than Jupiter, but Jupiter is so **T H I C C** that it looks clearer.",1
"I'm honestly not sure. The 30mm that came with it is a 2"". I purchased a 32mm 1.25 inch so I don't have to switch the adapter thing out. Next time we get some clear skies I'll pop it in and see.",1
"One of these days, when I upgrade to an actual astrophotography rig, I'm most definitely going to get a dedicated astro camera.",1
You can buy a moon filter pretty cheap that screws onto the eyepiece and makes it easier to see the detail without being blinded by the brightness.,1
"If you enjoy photography you should look into the ZWO cameras. I got the ASI224MC and it takes incredible pictures. I've had much better results with it than my DSLR.

They're pretty reasonably priced, you can get one for around $200",1
Do your parents know you’re out after dark?,1
That's... a cloud passing in front of the moon.,1
"These were actually taken on separate nights but all during 2016, I only included them in the same image to show them all together - so this is a composite image.",1
It’s the only logical explanation but it still looked pretty crazy in reallife,1
So cool you got all 7 planets in the same shot! Truly amazing.,1
"I’m pretty sure you’re seeing the clouds moving past the moon, not the moon itself moving.",1
Looks like some clouds moving past the moon,1
"I have that same scope and i am only doing visual observations. When I use the 30 mm eyepiece, I have to extend the focus tube all the way out to reach focus. Is it normal? Do you do the same?",1
"Yes, that's how I plan it.. telescope, later camera that can go with it, try some moon, Jupiter, Galileo moons. And I'll see later. Thanks for the tips, I saved your comment to check it later.",1
"Was it some kind of illusion or why did the moon seemingly rise in a matter of seconds? The footage is a little sped up to show how much space the moon travels, but the original footage taken just before minutes is only 30 seconds long. Obviously there must be a logical explanation for this so im asking you guys. I swear i didn‘t move my hands this is a serious question",1
"Hey man, whatever works!",1
Why wouldn't this result in the white dwarf simply going supernova?,1
"That is the best picture I could take of the eclipse. Shoot on my smartphone through a handheld binocular.

Thanks a lot. I have regi but I still prefer photoshop for stacking. Very accurate and easy to do.,1
"Honestly, I would get a telescope for visual use first, get to know the sky and love it. Then, when you can, move towards astrophotography. 

Personally, I feel like the images you take have a deeper impact when you've been looking at them through a telescope for a while. 

As awesome as the moon photo I took is, it's nothing as great as being ""wow'd"" every time you actually look at it through a scope. 

Visit r/telescope if you want to take the dive into visual first!",1
Thank you. I plan on starting this hobby once kids are bit older.,1
"After buying the telescope and extra accessories, around $700. That does not include the DSLR camera I already had. 

To be clear, my setup is 100% for visual use. You can also take some decent pictures of the moon and planets, but as far as nebulas, galaxies, and other DSO'S (Deep Sky Objects), it's a hard no. 

To take the crazy awesome pics of DSO'S you see posted here a lot, you need a setup that tracks the stars. You have to take long exposures of whatever you're trying to capture. If you don't have a scope/mount that tracks, the stars will ""trail"" and look like long streaks because they moved during the long exposure picture you took. Setups that are made for astrophotography and track are usually in the thousands. It's not cheap at all.",1
"Hi, considering going into astrophotography. How much did your setup cost you? Roughly?",1
"You run the video through PIPP and it outputs a series of stabilized images. You then run those through a program like autostakkert and that stacks the images in to a single photo.

Registax is great for sharpening the photo from there.

This is the best video out there on the process in my opinion, quick and simple.

https://youtu.be/6CVxcPoM8Xg",1
"For moon and planets observing/capturing, no. DSO's (deep sky objects) will be a good bit harder to see for sure.",1
"How do you extract a photo from the video file? 

My camera shoots 11 FPS. I have no issue with moon pictures. But I only have a zoom lease right now. Want to invest in a cheap scope just to try it out. Camera is a Sony a6000",1
Looks like I’m a 6. Is that too bright?,1
"Shooting 20+ frames per second allows you to gather thousands of frames in a short period of time, and manually track the planets by hand without worrying about controlling the camera at the same time.

Some of the frames will be good and some will be bad due to the turbulence of the atmosphere. You let computer software stabilize the video footage, trash the bad frames, and stack the good ones in to a single image.

If you take that many individual photos it will take forever and will eventually burn out the shutter in your dslr.",1
"Bortle 4. I can drive out to a bortle 3, but I haven't made the trip yet.",1
How dark is it where you are?,1

(6mm 9mm 15mm 20mm) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6LRCNN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_COkgEbC85AM8F

This is what you need to do ""lens projection"". You put the eyepiece inside the tube thing, then attach the tube to your camera where you normally attach a camera lense.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0140U9URO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_4PkgEbYW7N1N9

You'll also need a ""T-ring"" adapter so the tube thing with the eyepiece inside can attach to your camera. The T-rings are brand specific. I have a Canon, so I bought a random Canon T-rings adapter - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LABC2VW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_NTkgEbZDFY8PJ

Now, all this being said, I've been told by much more experienced people than me that using a Barlow lense instead of the eyepiece/eyepiece projection tube thing will get you a bit clearer picture. You attach the Barlow lense to the T-ring (you still need that). I have this Barlow lense and will be trying that next -  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008Y0TM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_fWkgEb7SAB7YX

I like that I have both options though, for when I want to zoom in more when using the camera than just the Barlow will allow. 

It took me a while to really piece together how everything works. If you have any specific questions about how to attach things and where, let me know and I'll help you out!",1
The moon looks pretty flat to me...,1
"Ha, i just ordered same telescope :) what do you use to connect camera to the OTA ? if you can give me a link (or just name) for canon would be great 

and what is 20mm ""redline"" lens, does it come with telescope ?

Thank you",1
"The Pentax SP WP 20x60 comes to mind. You might have to mount it, though. It does have a small field of view, but it's very sharp. 

Otherwise the Oberwerk LW 15x70 will give more brightness and can be handheld for a while. It has a generous field of view, and a large sweet spot. It also benefit from mounting.

Your 12x50 roof isn't phase coated so either of these Porros should be sharper and brigher(Porros doesn't need phase coating by design; roofs can only match Porros if they have phase coatings). Nikon makes a Monarch 16x56 roof that is phase coated, but that would be beyond your stated price range. Maybe you could look for a used one if you want that.  

There are various 20x80's, but the \~$100 ones are have low mechanical quality, and just barely usable optical quality.  Oberwerk LW 20x80's are decent for \~$200.  

Oberwerk Ultra series 15x70 are very good quality, both mechanical and optical, and $400. You do get what you pay for with these.

If you get a 12x50 roof with dielectric and phase coatings and ED objectives(Athlon Midas 12x50), it will be better, and can be had for $400.  It will be better quality and sharper/brighter but won't show SO much more unless you look closely.",1
"I guess it really depends on what you want to look at. You can go with less magnification and thus get a brighter, wider view, which will be better for deep sky viewing. 

What specifically bothers you about the current pair of binoculars you have? What do you want to get out of a new pair?",1
Awesome!,1

"Here's what you get with those eyepieces in your scope:

To find magnification, divide telescope focal length (900mm) by eyepiece focal length.

As magnification goes up, brightness goes down. Brightness is defined by exit pupil.

To find exit pupil, divide eyepiece focal length by telescope focal *ratio* (which is 7 for your scope).

&amp;#x200B;

|Eyepiece|Magnification|Exit Pupil |Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|25mm|36x|3.57mm|Brightest view, widest field of view of all your eyepieces. Use for larger deep sky objects like M42, M45, M33, M31 etc.|
|25mm + 2x barlow|72x|1.79mm|Useful for medium sized galaxies and nebulae, like M51, M27, M74, M82 and a several others.|
|10mm|90x|1.42mm|Similar to the 25mm + 2x barlow. A bit more magnification, and a bit dimmer view. Harder to look through due to short eye relief. More useful against bright globular clusters like M3, M13, M5 etc. Use on the moon and planets when the atmosphere is turbulent.|
|10mm + 2x barlow|180x|0.7mm|Roughly the highest practical magnification limit. Very dim view. Use on the moon and planets when the atmosphere is very steady.|",1
this is incredibly wholesome!!! happy stargazing🔭💫,1
"Chances are the 10mm is a Plossl, which means very tight eye relief. OP might find it more comfortable to use the 25mm + 2x barlow.",1
"Where I live, cold weather usually has the most turbulent atmosphere, as the jet stream is operating at full force. Your location may be different.",1
Oh it did. We got it for Christmas and have had like 3 clear nights so far. I finally had a chance to use it and attach my camera while my son was inside distracted. Now it's clouds again for the foreseeable future :/,1
It's just a projection. /s,1
"I spent a couple years waiting to afford a telescope, finally gave up and got some astrobinocs. If you think the moon looks cool in a scope (it does!), try it out in stereo with binocs. Seeing relief on the craters, the terminator, and depth of the whole thing is another great experience.",1

Definitely more than a few centuries for a significant effect!,1

"This was my first time trying to take an astro picture. 

How I took the picture - 

 Apertura AD8

Lens projection method using a 20mm ""redline"" lens since I can't reach prime focus.  
Canon T6i

I  took a handful of pics to capture the whole moon because it's so zoomed in with that setup. Then I used Microsoft's Image Composite Editor to input the images and stitch together the pictures. Finished with some basic editing in Snapseed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really excited for ""planet season"" to start so I can try my hand at capturing some :)",1
"Well, thanks! I just noob at this stuff, thank you for explaining everything!",1
"Talking about non-artificial objects here:

If it would fit the definition of a planet except its parent body is a planet and not a star, then it's a moon.

Everything else in orbit of a planet is a minor satellite.

This gives Earth one moon, Jupiter four moons, Saturn seven moons, Uranus five moons, Neptune one moon, and Pluto one moon. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitationally_rounded_objects_of_the_Solar_System))",1
"Not cloudy, if course. Cold? Depends on the humidity. Colder usually means less humid and that makes for clearer skies. However, very cold and a long time could mean frosting of the lens, eye pieces, and finders. Had to be below freezing, though.",1
"Usually those are the best conditions, yes, but if it is also windy you will see turbulence which will make it difficult to use high magnifications.",1
"Well you can see a lot of stuff with the naked eye, so you can see it in the telescope as well. But if you live in the city, then you’ll be limited to the brighter stuff like the Orion Nebula, Andromeda Galaxy (like you mentioned earlier), the Pleiades, the planets, and the Moon. You’ll be severely limited with that 80mm aperture though, unfortunately, as it can’t collect much light. Better than your eyes though.

Also be careful with that mount - it will be very wobbly despite their claims of stability. I’d suggest hanging something like a milk jug filled with sand in the bottom, to stabilise the tripod. And don’t extend the tripod, leave the legs at their lowest setting.

Photography is possible with your phone, but only of the Moon, and planets if you’re lucky. Anything else requires long exposures and a **good** equatorial mount to counteract the Earths movement, which can easily cost $1000USD for the bare minimum. Astrophotography isn’t just point and shoot like daytime photography, and is a super expensive hobby.",1
Is it good if it's very cold and uncloudy outside?,1
"The Moon is currently moving 3.8 cm (~1.5"") away from the Earth each year, and moving a tiny bit less every year. Using today's rate, even over 100,000 years, thats only a difference of 9.65 km (~6 miles). 

The Moon is 385,000 km away on average, with an rough average perigee of 362,000 km, and a rough average apogee of 405,400. 

Therefore, the difference in Earth to Moon distance between the two halves of OPs picture is about 43,400 km

Changing that by another 10km isn't going to be perceptible without using laser ranging. 

Over the course of millions of years you'd be able to see a visible difference, and because the rate at which the Moon has been receding from Earth is slowing down, the further back in time you go the more pronounced the difference it. 

People have mentioned that eventually the Moon will move far enough away that total eclipses will no longer occur, but that time frame is estimated to be 600 million years.",1
"The difference is even bigger, but by a really small fraction,  when the picture is taken with a focal lenght of the eye compared to a telescope .( when pictures of two bodys the same size are taken at two diffent distances)

The more you zoom in (the bigger the focal lenght) the less apparent is this difference in the picture size as you approach an orthographic/paralell projection. 

So it is indeed dependend as he said, but the other way around.",1
"Better to know that in advance, so we cal all wear our tin foil hats.",1
"[Here's a slightly simplified image](http://www.scienceline.ucsb.edu/images/Lunar-orbit12.jpg).

When the moon is on the ""left"" its slightly closer and appears bigger. When on the ""right"" is further away and appears smaller.

There's not really a left or right though, because the point that's furthest away progresses along the orbital path with each orbit, because the time between apogee and perigee isn't exactly the same as the time it takes the moon to complete a full orbit. Plot it over a long enough time and it makes a big series of loops like the old Spirograph toy.",1
r/mildlypenis,1
"OK, Please bear in mind that photography is subjective, There is no right or wrong answer, just personal preference.

I think your composition is very well timed, having part of the moon in shadow highlights crater detail and gives depth and shape of the image. Whereas a full moon, in my opinion is pretty flat and boring as nothing is in shade.

As far as the colours go, the the moon subtle is key, there isn't much colour on it anyway so you need to replicate that in your image by only having hints if the colours you see in the posted image, cut back on the saturation and you should see a more natural image.

&amp;#x200B;

Like i said, these are only my opinions, so please don't take them as the ""Correct"" way to do things.",1
"25mm + 2x Barlow = 12.5mm \~ 10mm. Unless the 10mm is particularly bad quality it will give a better image of about the same magnification than the 25mm + Barlow.

10mm with a 2x Barlow is 5mm, which will require good atmospheric conditions to be useful.

You should always start with the lowest magnification (25mm) and then increase the magnification in stages until you either get the view you want or the atmospheric conditions (turbulence) prevent you from going further.",1
So how do I improve,1
"I all honesty, i think you have overdone the colours.",1
This is genuinely cool work! Many thanks.,1
Either long gone or have expanded so much into the galaxy we wouldn’t care or if we did we’ll probably just use technology to somehow fix it,1

Dude it also follows you in a car! I definitely saw it as a child. That fucking stalker,1
"No. It's just moving away from us at a rate of about 3-4cm/year. The only consequence of this will be that a few centuries later total solar eclipse won't be possible, as the Moon's apparent size in the sky would be smaller than the Sun. All eclipses would be either partial or Annular",1
"And then there’s the crazy effect of the “moon on the horizon” illusion, which I’ve just never been able to completely accept as a purely visual illusory process, even though that’s what the textbooks say. It just seems so damn real. Maybe with your cool camera gear you could do a similar comparison shot of the moon soon after rising when it “looks” super huge and then another a few hours later, same zoom setting of course, when it’s higher in the sky and doesn’t look huge anymore. Is there really a difference in apparent diameter, as there seems to be, or is it in fact an illusion?",1
Truly beautiful. What an amazing photo my friend!,1
Flat earthers will take this as evidence of NASA's inconsistant photoshop or something,1
Good point. I admire your knowledge,1
"The moons orbit is an ellipse, not a perfect circle. Sometimes it's closer to Earth, sometimes it's further. This picture shows the apparent size difference when it's at it's closest and it's furthest. This is what people mean when they say super moon",1

"Well planets are easy, because their colours are more noticeable, and they’re much brighter than most of the stars. They don’t twinkle as well. Venus is super bright and only visible during dawn/dusk, same thing as Mercury but it’s not as bright, Jupiter appears not as bright as Venus but it’s still bright and slightly beige, Saturn has a goldenish colour, and Mars is very red, especially during opposition.

Identifying stars by their names will be basically impossible without a star chart though, or any point of reference. If you want to avoid devices, then nothing beats a good old paper planisphere. It shows all the brighter stars, at any date and time. But you have to get one for your specific latitude. 

You could however figure out how far specific stars are from a known star by using your hands. An extended fist is about 10° wide, and your thumbs fingernail is about 0.5°. It’s very rough and choppy, but it could work.",1
"Definitive proof, you heard it here first!",1
How long is it to compete one cycle from perigee to perigee?,1

Depending on orbital parameters pre-encounter, a gravity assist could eject stuff from our solar system.

Well it swung around the blackhole and it's now on its way out...",1

"Yes, and it has been doing so since it formed. Not so long ago, in Ancient Greek days total Solar eclipses which much more dramatic, completely blocking out even the outer Corona of the sun.

I’m just bummed that no electromagnetic counterpart could be found.,1
This article actually got me thinking about strange scenario. Since we sense the changes in speed (such as accel and decel) relative to our present speed of travel what if there was an object that passed close enough to the Earth that was large enough to effect the speed of the orbit. What would it feel like if the entire planet slowed down or sped up even by a small amount. Im imagining a lot of intense wind and objects flying all over the place chaotically.,1

"NASA's Parker Solar Probe captured this [astonishing prospect of Earth swimming in a sea of stars](https://vimeo.com/383744252) over the course of ten days in April 2019. Earth is the first bright round spot that shows up and moves to the right of the frame before the Milky Way is seen. The Moon was too close to Earth to be resolved. The background star near Earth is Spica. Mercury is seen in transit across the Milky Way core. Venus is the very bright spot at the end. Jupiter and Saturn are also seen. The stripes are cosmic rays hitting the camera sensor.

Disclaimer: I am not an astronomer. 

The race around the black hole can be remarkably short: a few decades. (There was a beautiful video of the centre of the Milky Way a few weeks ago that showed a few stars going halfway around the black hole in tens of years)

During this period, if nothing else, you would expect the planet’s trajectory to change, become more elliptical, faster, or slower. Whatever it is, the planet’s climate will change massively, and possibly wipe out most life forms, making room for others.  

If you’re unlucky, could the planet be stolen by the black hole, and end up curving the black hole?

That is only true for a time where degrees didn't exist. Anyway, it is not the degree that matters. Look what all these people had in common: They knew what has been discovered before, and they were in regular contact with other scientists while working on their discoveries. From your post I can tell that this doesn't apply to you. You don't even know what a theory is. You didn't bother to learn what we have figured out already, you didn't bother to check all the measurements that have been done already.

Naively this would be a factor 1000 in event rate but for large binary black holes it will just cover the whole observable universe, so the increase is smaller. It should still see events at a really rapid rate.",1

"Your premise is wrong. Scientists love to prove themselves right, and the more people they prove wrong in the process the better.

Your theories are probably riddled with mistakes and misconceptions that are only readily obvious to people with a formal education in the field. Maybe they've even been thought of before and gone through the gauntlet of academic peer review and been dismissed. Maybe they would violate the laws of thermodynamics. Your missing piece of paper probably isn't why they thought you were dumb.

Maybe they're not even that bad in a vacuum but there's no evidence base that makes engaging with it worthwhile. Say I have some theory about why lions preferentially hunt zebras instead of wildebeest. It would make sense to find out whether zebras are actually a lion's preferred prey beforehand, right?

Maybe you're just off-putting in the way you approach people with your ideas. Maybe it's a combination of all the above.

I also now starting a course that is called ""Highlights of astronomy"" which has very little math and more about learning these facts, because i personally have no interest in learning the hard core math/physics behind everything. I feel like going into astronomy as a career is very little star gazing and more about analyzing data and allot of math and physics (yet im no expert so maybe an actual astronomy major wants to comment on their experience).

"It would be an honor, thank you! If you ever publish it online, feel free to link it so I can give it a read (or a look if it's a visual one!)

And you're right, even the Heliacal Rising of the Pleiades (which is an important time for astronomy observations) has so many matches around the world's different cultures that every year when I see it, there is a special feeling that is very hard to describe. Almost like every person that has ever lived on the planet and has observed the same sight is connected in some kind of way, under one single sky. It's a very deep thought process.

Best of luck with your project!",1
"Yes, this is actually one of the more massive and dense clusters known. Maya II, a cluster in Andromeda, is the only known more massive cluster. The stars in the core of Omega Centauri, however, are extremely crowded, estimated to be around 0.1 light years away from each other on average. Omega Centauri is overall a 'one of a kind' cluster in several aspects, so much so that it is considered to possibly be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that once merged with the Milky Way.

Remember, however, that globular clusters are spherical structures, and therefore 150 light years refers to a spherical diameter.

Let's do some quick calculations with this for fun!

150 light years diameter means over 1.75 million cubic light years of volume are contained within the globular cluster sphere, which is quite substantial. Assuming a majority of intermediate mass, low mass and dwarf stars in the cluster (not a bad assumption to make, given its age is around 12 billion years), and taking the Sun's diameter (a low mass star) as an 'average stellar diameter' (Sun's diameter is 696,000km) for the 10 million stars, that gives us a TOTAL stellar volume of around 20.8 cubic light years of stars.

Approx. 1,767,146 cubic light years of cluster volume vs approx. 20.8 cubic light years of stellar volume - that means that  approx. 0.0012% of the cluster volume is actually occupied by stars.

10 million stars is a LOT, but 150 light years of spherical diameter makes for one hell of a sphere! :)

Edit: arranged some values, should now be correct.",1
"Too bad. Well, at least you probably get to enjoy a nice dark sky. Get out just to observe the sky, trying to understand the sky motion, trying to identify the different constellations and bright stars (some software like Stellarium will help a lot in that sense) is a good way to start. If you can get a hold of some 10x50 binoculars (or 7x50 as well) you're in for a good treat!

Cheers from Argentina! Sometimes I forget how crazy it is to be talking things with people from very far away and from a totally different culture, by just sharing the love for the night sky.",1
"Yes, the Pleiades myth is a very interesting one because it transcends time and space. Different separate cultures at different times in history came up with that same myth and it's fascinating. But the ancient Greek and the Aboriginal version of that myth are very much alike, unlike other versions.   
This ties in with George Miller's heritage (He's Greek, living in Australia. Studied Aboriginal myths as well) and his fascination with Joseph Campbells theory of the 'monomyth' i.e. that we as human beings are hardwired to repeat the same stories...  
I think George Miller tried to tell us something with Fury Road, that this story has already been told and we didn't even notice it.  
So if anything, if any of this is a reference to the Pleiades myth, the entirety of Fury Road and storytelling - then thank you for your expertise, I will credit you after I finish this project :)",1

It could definitely be, or at least it's a very nice coincidence! Your research sounds great, I researched for personal interest the Pleiades myth in the different cultures of the world, and it's very very surprising how similar some of those can be! 

You're welcome, glad to be of help! :)",1
"Also, you can check if there's a local astronomy club near you. They probably offer some sort of introductory course and believe me, joining one is probably one of the best decisions you can make in your path as an amateur astronomer. You'll learn a lot and surely make new friends who share your passion with the subject.",1
"My theory is that George Miller referenced the myth of the Pleiades in his movie by inserting that scene in. But you brought up an interesting point!:  
The Pleiades myth is very similar in ancient Greek mythology and Aboriginal ""Creation Stories"". It's about 7 Wives escaping from an evil man. George Miller admitted that he couldn't fit all 7 wives into the car in Fury Road so he made it 5 wives + Furiosa. Furiosa is also a former wife, so that makes it 6.  
Now you mentioned that the cluster is missing one star, I'm thinking it could be a reference to that.  


As far as placement of the stars, I'm pretty sure there were some creative liberties made. Thank you for your help, it's a bit more eye opening now! :)",1

"It could be, but two things to note (if they are relevant to your project):

1 - That one seems to be the most likely star cluster to resemble the Pleiades, but it's missing a star

2 - The Pleiades, even from the Southern Hemisphere, are not so close to the Milky Way, and not on its right side. They would be a bit more distant, and on the left side.

I know, I'm being petulant on a movie scene, but I don't know if these info could be useful to you :)",1

"Your first paragraph is exactly what I was talking about. I too started as an amateur astronomer, and even though I love my job, at the end of the day it's just that, a job. I have days where I wish I was working on something else, just like everyone else feels at one point or another I guess.

As for your last question, it depends a lot on what your current level is and where you want to go next. If you already have a good understanding of astronomy at a popular science level, and if you have a solid background in physics, you could try with proper textbooks such as ""An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics"" by Carroll &amp; Ostlie, and ""Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology"" by Schneider.",1
Woww❤️,1
"This kind of goes back to what I very lightly touched on with the ""kids don't ever know what career paths exist and then just give up"". Not that I'm doubting your intelligence so please don't take it as such. What I mean is that, a lot of fields never really....get a voice? So to speak. You don't have to be the next einstein to be smart enough to be in physics or astronomy (or astrophysics). You do, however, have to find your shortcomings and be determined to have the work ethic required to work on them. The world only ever sees the Einsteins or the Teslas or the Sagans but I can promise you you don't need some superior mental status to make it in the field. Ive known a lot of average scientists and I promise you they, too, would look incompetent next to Feynman (as would I) but theyre still scientists because they still have that nagging curiosity and that desire to learn and solve problems. Most scientists aren't geniuses. The world just never sees that so they get discouraged because theyll never be Tyson so they figure why bother?

Maybe I can help give more guidance if you know what other science job (not necessarily specifically, just vague description) youd want if you followed through.",1
"Thank you for the insight. That is another part that pulls me in another direction. As I have a passion for space and have made it a strong hobby of mine, I don't want to make a hobby a job. If you worked in a cheese sandwich factory, would you want to eat cheese sandwiches anymore? 

On the other hand, I feel like something calls me in that direction. If not a scientist that researches groundbreaking technologies and advances in the human race, at least SOMETHING in the space field. Hell, I was offered a machinist apprenticeship from a good friend of mine. I could acquire my journeyman level machinist and work for SpaceX.. but do I really want to do that?

"That's just it. I would pursue an education/career path in physics or something along those lines, but I have accepted the fact that I more than likely cannot mentally reach that point. aka, I am simply not smart enough. I know the old saying ""you can do anything if you put your mind to it,"" but we all know that has very large grey areas. We can't all be astronauts or brain surgeons. Some of us just aren't intelligent enough and don't have the mental capacity.

I suppose I wouldn't truly know until I tried, but at my age, I don't want to waste *more* time trying to live a fantasy that may never unfold. I do, however, enjoy environmental science - which I suppose is more chemistry than physics.

I have the means to support myself with just a part-time job for now. If I used my GI bill to go back to school, I make money off of that as well, at least until I've hit my funding cap.

"Hi! I'm a professional astronomer, so I can offer some advice. Pursuing a career in astrophysics is tough. As you say, postgraduate studies are a must for any job as a researcher. Graduating in physics and then getting a MSc+PhD typically takes 10 years, give or take, depending on the country.

The job market is rather competitive, as the number of new PhDs granted each year has grown way faster than the number of new permanent positions. Also, you must be willing to relocate, not just to different cities but most likely to different countries as well. Not everyone enjoys this lifestyle. I don't want to discourage you, just give you a realistic view of how the situation is. Keep in mind that loving X and working in X are two very different things. I've seen people enroll in (astro)physics studies only to realize that it's not how they thought it would be.

That being said, pursuing your passion is a praiseworthy goal. I have a friend who decided to do (and finished!) a PhD in astrophysics after he retired, just for fun (he'd studied physics and used to work in the energy sector). I also know engineers who decided to halt their careers to do a PhD. If your job offers enough flexibility, you may want to look into evening classes or online ones, to see how it's like.",1

With an 8 inch Dobsonian long exposures will unfortunately not be possible, but you can try do some planetary imaging ! Since planetary imaging involves taking videos rather than long exposures, you can take videos of the planet moving across the field of view, then align the frames before stacking (in programs such as PIPP) and you’re good to go!

"I don't know if you're also an American or not, so if not some of this might be a miss but bear with the overall message if you're from somewhere else. It's mostly still all applicable.

Despite what people seem to think, our modern society is built almost entirely on quick-paced trial-and-error. People forget that our current societal structure is very new, not just in terms of the universe but even in terms of human history. Just 200 years ago, we didn't have ANY of this, and we sure as hell didn't have the whole world's knowledge at our fingertips even as far back as a couple generations ago. For a long time, we had this expectation that our kids would go to school when it was convenient, but mostly help with family business/income. Then it became that kids were required to go to school 180 days a year so America could stay ahead, then they would go on to help their families. Then it became that kids would go to school 180 days a year and could help their families or go to college. Now we have this notion that kids must go to school 180 days a year for twelve years and they better know what they want to go to college for or else. But this structure is so new that the actual school system itself never had time to adjust. So most kids go through school with no idea what career paths exist because they've spent twelve years memorizing Chinese dynasties, how to solve for x on an imaginary line they don't understand, and that if they don't know the answer to guess ""c"". We see this because the number of people who switch majors in college, or just give up and drop out when they don't like what they thought they wanted, is astronomical *badumtiss*.

I think it's entirely fair to say a large portion of the population never finds their niche because of how the school system works, and a large portion that do find it one day don't find it until later in life. And that's perfectly okay. Life isn't about these weird capitalist ideologies. You don't exist to surpass people and make tons of money to spend on tons of stuff. Life's a beautiful thing we are just meant to enjoy while we have it.

I would 100% recommend using your GI bill to go back to school if astronomy feels like it fills a...space...in your life. (Sorry I'll stop with the puns.) A lot of people will argue that it's a waste of time because of your age but it's not. Science is about expanding human knowledge, so as long as you have a functioning brain and can find ways to contribute, by all means do, whether you're a 10 year old prodigy, an 80 year old late bloomer, or somewhere in between. The more minds working in a problem, the more viewpoints it gets, making the chances of solving it higher.

However, I do have to make you aware of the realities. 1) You will need to make sure you can afford to....yk....exist while you're in school. Don't forget to find a way to cover expenses before diving in and don't bite off more classes at a time than your time/expense allotment can handle. 2) You will need a ph.d. in astronomy for a good research position, which means you'll about 50. If you're good with that, awesome, if not, maybe reconsider. 3) It will initially be hard to get a job in the field, especially at 50. Fortunately, because to get a ph.d. requires basically a research assistant type position, it wont be a HUGE hindrance. But it will be a hindrance nonetheless. 4) I would strongly advise a double major with physics if you do astronomy. You'll have way more options in the job field. 5) You 100% have to be okay with a lot of math. i would run through khan academy and maybe some edx archived/self-paced courses to catch up if you're not up to a calculus 1 understanding before enrolling or you will fall behind fast. Both are free and very useful, in case you've never heard of them.",1
I have a huge interest in black holes,1
"Is there anything in specific you want to learn about? Astronomy is a vast field of study, and only a very small part of it is pretty sky pictures. If all you’re interested in is finding pretty things to look at, I would point you at vastly different resources than if you wanted to learn about what black holes are like.

Pretty sky pictures are, of course, worthwhile for their own sake, but there is usually not a whole lot of scientific use to them.",1

"I took these photos a few days ago and only now have I made something out of them. This is my first time imaging around Alnitak. I have some heavy light pollution where shot these (my backyard in northern Croatia). I don't even have a polar finder scope so I had to eyeball at Polaris and make a hundred or so test shots. 

\-Taken with a Skywatcher reflector telescope (150 aperture and 750mm focal length) from my backyard.

\-EQ3 mount with added dual-axis motors

\-No auto-guiding whatsoever, just the telescope and my old unmodified Canon 1300D camera that had some damage done to its sensor beforehand

\-No filters were used

\-I can't expose for more than 30 seconds on my camera I took:

\~150x30""@ISO800 (50 bias frames, 40 darks, and no flats)

\~200x30""@ISO1600 (50 bias frames, 30 darks, and 50 flats)

Total integrated exposure time= 3 hours

Unfortunately, my lack of equipment forces me to stand right next to the telescope at them freezing temperatures and press the shutter button on the camera every few minutes.  

The photos were quickly edited in 5 mins on Affinity photo, just dragged some levels sliders and tried to subtract the present light pollution with subtraction mode on layers. I will come back to the photo soon, but now I don't have the time.

I would appreciate hearing your honest thoughts!",1

"Well a dobsonian is still “entry level”, just at the higher end. It can also last you a lifetime, as long as you don’t get the dreaded “aperture fever”. :)

One of my old teacher told me “cheap tools cost more than expensive tools” which is true - buying a good tool (in this case, a 6-8” dobsonian) will save you money in the long run than if you just kept on buying cheaper ones (a bad telescope).

Dobs look intimidating and big, but they’re actually really easy to use. They’re so intuitive that you could figure out how to use one in just a couple minutes of using it, as you just move up down, left right. They’re rock solid too, and are way more stable than anything mounted on a tripod.

With enough practice (probably a few weeks), you could be manually tracking things like planets or the ISS (like what I did) with ease, even though they move quite quickly in the eyepiece of a telescope. Check out r/telescopes as well.",1
Well I only bought it today so it never shipped.,1
"That's okay I appreciate good advice that will save me disappointment later.
You're saying it's better to invest in something good rather than an ""entry level"" thing?",1
"You will probably look through that telescope two times and never use it again. Since you bought it on Amazon, return it immediately, and get a table top dobsonian instead.",1
Am I just seeing things or do we get a purple glow  on the horse and rider when scrolling up and down on the photo?,1
One of the models for this planet is that it could be an ocean world. The ocean currents (like we have on earth) could transfer heat throughout the planet.,1
"I think you’re getting things mixed up. Guiding is completely different to tracking - tracking is **essential** for astrophotography. 

Guiding is the use of a small telescope or device 
called an off axis guide which takes light from the main scope, and a small camera to capture any small errors in the mount (e.g. imperfections in the gears or motor, not so perfect polar alignment, light wind, poor balance, etc), and then sends a signal to the mount in order to correct it. 

But tracking is when you have a motor which has a shaft that is aligned to the celestial pole and rotates at the speed of Earth’s rotation. You need tracking, but guiding isn’t essential (though still very helpful).",1
"OP, I know this might sound rude or whatever, but please cancel the order and return that scope. You will just get frustrated with that scope and it’s poor quality optics and mounting system.

The moon and planets will have ugly colour fringing around them, and the brighter stars will appear purple. The mount will also shake for numerous seconds when you even just slightly touch the focuser, or a light gust of wind blows in your direction. This is more prominent the higher you set the tripod up. These kinds of scopes are called hobby killers, because they’re just so frustrating to use and you’d likely lose interest in the hobby.

You’d be much better off with a dobsonian telescope, which although is a bit more expensive, will be so much better in the long run and can last you much longer than what that puny 70mm refractor can offer. 

Dobsonians are basically reflector telescopes mounted on a sturdy wooden base. Technically refractors will offer better views, but in the lower end range, reflectors will always outperform cheap refractors. 

Depending on your budget, there are a wide range of dobsonians available. The standard recommendation would be an 8” dobsonian by either Apertura, Skywatcher, or Orion. They sell for about $400-450 USD, but it’s better to get the Apertura because it comes with better/more accessories and is worth the price difference. But optically, they’re pretty much the same. Worldwide the Apertura is sold by many different names such as GSO Deluxe, Bintel, or Astornz.

The best recommendation would be a 6” dob, but there are less options available so you’ll have to get one either by Skywatcher or Orion. The two actually come from the same factory, so it doesn’t matter which one you get. But the Skywatcher comes with more accessories. They sell for about $300USD.

There are also cheaper options like the AWB OneSky or Skywatcher Herirage for $200USD, or the Orion Skyscanner for $100, but they obviously don’t show as much as the above versions. You really get what you pay for.

If $100 is out of your scope (pun intended), then you’d be better off with a good pair of binoculars. Seriously, cheap refractors suck and you’d just be disappointed with the views you get.",1
"It would be almost as bright as the full moon (apparent magnitude of -12) and it would last for a few weeks at minimum.

Unfortunately it won't happen in your lifetime. But there's actually another star that has a higher chance of going supernova, the one in the Carina nebula.",1

"It is you who are stubborn. Just because you cannot see a way does not mean no one else will see a way. And there are other methods of colonising than putting 1000 humans on a multi generational ship. Other concepts involve sending frozen embryonic humans with robotic caretakers that would take care of them, harvest resources and build infrastructure. This would drastically reduce the weight we need to send over. Once we have reached a certain point in technology Von Neumann machines become viable. And so what if the journey takes 10^x years? Colonising another planet is not something that can or should be undertaken for the benefit of an individual, an organisation or even a country. It is for the human race.",1

"Non-rotating fluid bodies only subject to their own gravity assume the shape of a perfect sphere (becoming slightly oblate when rotating), while those same bodies orbiting around another body tend to do that on the equatorial plane of that body. There is no contradiction in that and you see it in any planetary system, solar system or galaxy. 99% of the solar system mass (Sun excluded) is concentrated on the ecliptic plane just as 99% of the mass of the Saturn planetary system (Saturn excluded) is concentrated on Saturn's equatorial plane, of which its rings are the most evident examples.

This simply happens because of collisions among bodies, which conserve angular momentum but destroy tangential velocities, and because of the irregularities (most of the times, the oblateness of the body) of the bodies themselves, which slowly dissipate gravitational energy to reach a minimum in a perfectly circular, tidal-locked orbit on the main host's equatorial plane.",1
What he/she is saying is: Super Bowl is a pathetic comparison to such a grand event. Super Bowl = two cities... from the US. 4000 scientists is more like the football World Cup.,1
this sounds accurate to what i remember from various astronomy courses as well.,1
Galaxies start their life as large cluster of stars called elipticle galaxies but over time due to the angular momentum the stars will all start moving in the same direction around the centre of mass and will start to flatten out. The elipticle galaxy will become a spiral galaxy or a barred spiral galaxy (this is what the milky way is). We actually see something similar happening to the earth with it being wider at the equator becuase of its spin. At least that's what I got from the lectures I didn't sleep through 🤷‍♂️,1
To the best of my knowledge it just has to do with rotation.  Elliptical galaxies are more steroid in nature but they arent rotating around their black hole like the milky way and similar spiral galaxies.  It's the same reason planets orbit a star on a generally level orbital plane.,1
Man the night sky would look awesome from a planet around one of those 10 million stars.,1

"&gt;so if that's the case, the there is no dark energy and no acceleration to the expanding univeres.

There are still other independent measurements that point to an accelerated universe. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/el5mtd/new_evidence_shows_that_the_key_assumption_made/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) for a discussion.

&gt;Are we looking at a closed universe then?

That would depend on the 'new' matter content, if it needs adjusting. Basically the energy density of matter + dark energy - curvature (converted to units of energy) has to be equal to one. Right now we think matter = 0.3 (30%) and dark energy = 0.7 (70%), making the curvature 0. If we just get rid of the dark energy and leave matter at 30%, then the curvature becomes -0.7 which would mean a hyperbolic (open) geometry. A positive contribution of curvature would mean it's closed.

However, the curvature has been independently measured to be very close to zero, so in order to get rid of dark energy, the matter energy contribution would have to be very close to 1.",1

"Unfortunatley dont have a school that has a scientific access portal: this project is purley indepedent/passion project. Also took a look at a few databases, and they are horribly complex, and even after finally figuring out how to search up a star, I could only find paralax, apparent magnitude, and motion information, which is bassically useless to what I'm trying to make.

It does make sense considering that total mass, bolometric luminosity, and solar radii size can't be determined from just direct observation, and thus for a general sky survey/star catalog its not going to be in there.

I think I will use Wikepedia just to start out with, since its the most up-to-date source on star masses, luminosities and tempatures (the only other sources where I could find other mass statistics aren't even official sources with their own bibliographies). Astrophysics data 'aint really that plentiful on the internet. But when I can I will make sure that the statistics I am are still veriafiable through a paper and I will go to the paper and actually verify it.

"Budget? The standard recommendation is an 8” dobsonian telescope, which are sold under many names by many different brands. However, the brand doesn’t matter too much because there’s really only two telescope manufacturers in the low end range of astronomy - Synta and GSO.

I’d personally recommend the Apertura AD8, which retails for about $450USD. There are cheaper options such as the Orion XT8 or the Skywatcher Skyline 200P, but the Apertura comes with much better accessories, and are definitely worth the extra $50 or so. It’ll be cheaper in the long run anyways.

If the 8” is too expensive, you could get a 6” version for about $300USD which is still a great scope, but won’t show as much as the 8”, as aperture is king in visual astronomy. There’s not many 6” dobs in the market, so just get something like a Skywatcher Skyliner 150P or Orion XT6, though I’d recommend the former because it has better accessories, though not as good as the Apertura.

If the 6” is still too expensive, then your only option would be a 5” tabletop dobsonian such as the AWB OneSky or Skywatcher Heritage 130P (both the exact same thing, but the AWB is only available in the US), which sell for about $200USD. I have one of them and they’re pretty nice, though you will need something sturdy to put them on. I use a milk crate to put the scope on. and a chair from the dining table for me to sit on.

If $200 is out of your realm, then you’ll have to either look through your classifieds to find a used dobsonian, or buy binoculars. 95% of telescopes under $200 are either literal junk, or just too small that you’ll get bored very quickly. A $100 pair of binoculars will likely outperform a $100 scope, and you have the benefit of a wide FOV, which will be great for learning the night sky. You can also use binoculars even if you upgrade to a proper telescope.

Avoid Celestron Powerseekers (r/dontbuyapowerseeker) and GoTo telescopes, because cheaper GoTo telescopes will have a tiny scope because the electronics are expensive so not much of the budget goes to the optics, and GoTo doesn’t make things easier - it often complicates everything to the point some people quit because they hated having to do so much setup, even if they just want to do a quick observation session. They’re known as hobby killers for a reason.",1

"Since your light frames were taken at a slightly lower temperature they will have a bit less thermal noise that your dark frames, so you will be very slightly overcorrecting them and introducing a little bit of additional noise. However a degree or two at -3 or so will only make a slight difference. It would make much more difference at  around +15 degrees C and almost no difference at -15 C. The exact effect will depend on the camera - it's useful to make a graph of dark current with temperature so you can estimate the effect:

[http://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/images/signaltonoisefigure2.jpg](http://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/images/signaltonoisefigure2.jpg)

(you could use a plot like that to scale your dark frame but for that small a difference it's probably not worth it).

To answer your second question, ideally yes, you should take dark frames either side of your light frames at the same temperature for best results, but of course that eats into light exposure time, so again, is it worth it? Probably not unless the temperature is really varying a lot. A peltier cooled camera with temperature stabilisation is the best solution.

PS a bias frame is not the same thing as dark frame, a bias frame is taken with zero (or as close to zero as possible) integration time and gives the 'zero point' of the signal on the chip, hence it is also sometimes called a zero frame. The zero point does not vary with integration time and ideally should not vary with temperature. 

The dark frame gives the dark (thermal) signal and will accumulate with integration time and increase with temperature.",1

I'm really hoping Betelgeuse actually lives up to the recent hype and beats out the southern hemisphere for once.,1
"Nebulae are basically any cloud of gas or dust in space, and can formed by many different processes. Supernova remnants are what you're thinking of; this is a Wolf-Rayet nebula formed as fast winds from the central star (1700 km/s in this case) sweep up slower-moving material ejected during earlier stages of its evolution into a shell, resulting in the bubble-like structure. At the same time, intense radiation from the star (EZ CMa has a temperature of 89,000 K and a luminosity 620,000 times that of the sun) heats up and ionises the material, leading to the observed emission features.",1
"This has to rank #1 on the list of ""nebulae that actually look like the thing they're meant to look like""",1
"Ohh. My EOS 70D weighs 755g, so I think I might get some flexure, unless I upgrade my focuser to something fancier. Possibly a Moonlite but I don’t think it’s a good idea to buy a focuser which is worth 2x the cost of the scope itself. Thanks anyways.",1
How does a nebula get formed by a star about explode ? Shouldn't nebula be a place where new stars are born ?,1
"I didn’t experience any noticeable flexing or slippage, although I cannot say for certain that there wasn’t any flexing whatsoever (this camera is quite light - I do get noticeable flexing with a Nikon D610, for example). As regards the coma corrector, I too was expecting some noticeable coma towards the edges, but it was flat throughout - pinpoint stars to the edge of the frame. The only cropping I had to do here was a result of dithering and stacking, which is normal. There is uneven illumination due to the small secondary, but nothing that cannot be easily fixed with flats - artificial or otherwise.",1
An Orion Atlas could hold a 8” OTA. but the long focal length and back focus will be a massive PITA.,1
"Awesome, that's no problem. I know the feeling about the lack of funds for this hobby, especially being students aha. Good luck to you!",1
"Did you experience any slippage, flexing or tilting of the focuser when you had it loaded with a DSLR and coma corrector? And speaking about coma correctors, was it sharp across the whole frame? Apparently the generic Skywatcher one doesn’t work well for APS-C, but I wanted to get a few more opinions.",1

"Best option for dobs is an [Equatorial platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_platform). You'd need an enormously expensive mount to smoothly handle the weight of an 8"" dob.",1
"I think you'd need to find a motorised EQ mount that can hold the tube but I dont know of any. Orion have a manual object finder you can add to take you to things but doesn't move on it's own.

What is your plan for tracking stuff, for astro photography or other things? If it is for astrophoto work you need the rotation on the mount which a non EQ mount doesn't have.",1
Not sure if a kit is available for an xt8. The difference is the dob is alt/az as opposed to equatorial so if you're thinking of tracking for pics field rotation is an issue.,1
Why the specific time and date?,1
I added some of what you suggested. More app updates coming soon. The next update will let you walk around in the surface of each planet,1
"**Image Details**

The Heart Nebula lies some 7500 light years away from Earth and is located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by William Herschel on 3 November 1787. It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.

The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896 and known as the Fish Head Nebula, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. The nebula's intense red output and its morphology are driven by the radiation emanating from a small group of stars near the nebula's center. This open cluster of stars at the Heart's heart, known as Melotte 15, contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction of our Sun's mass.

"The blue star is [EZ CMa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ_Canis_Majoris), a [23 solar mass](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04687.pdf) Wolf-Rayet star. WR stars have fast radiation-driven stellar winds with extreme mass loss rates, and are often found with spectacular nebulae surrounding them. The red star is [o1 CMa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omicron1_Canis_Majoris), a red supergiant whose mass is likely &gt;12 solar masses (see [page 7 here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04094.pdf)).

Both stars are solidly on their way to core-collapse, although neither are expected to do so anytime soon. o1 CMa will blow up as a Type II supernova, while EZ CMa will end its life in a Type Ib/c supernova as it has completely shed its hydrogen envelope.",1
"Yes, because they’re not calibrated. If at the 0 hour one is pointing to the ground and the other is pointing to the side, then they’re not calibrated. Once you calibrate them, when you point them at 6 hours, it’ll point in the same direction regardless of which mount is used. But just don’t use them like I said - they’re pointless and misleading.",1

Energy becomes greater than gravity. And the star ejects it's outer layers forming a nebula. The remnant is either a white dwarf/black hole etc...",1
"So my “about to go” and space “about to go” are two very different things, I guess my question’s when’s this bad bitch blowing her blowhole?",1
"That’s because they need to be calibrated against a star with known co-ordinates. For example if a star has a right accession of 6 hours, you need to rotate the setting circles until they show 6 hours.",1

"It's called the ecliptic. It's the imaginary line, made up of constellations, on which the sun moves throughout the year. There are 12 constellations and they're the ones that the horoscope gets the names from (Leo, Virgo, Scorpio, Cancer, etc). I think each month or rather the sign represents where The Sun currently is. Taken from a 3rd point of view of the Sun-Earth system if you draw an imaginary line infinitely long through the two bodies, then that part of the line which goes from the Earth through The Sun, is looking straight at one of the 12 constellations. Now if you move the Earth around the Sun the imaginary line also moves and goes through all the 12 constellations throughout the year. Entering Capricorn basically just means that the line is just starting its part of the journey through the constellation Capricorn.
My explanation is a bit sloppy and English isn't my first language but I hope it answers your question. There are a lot of gifs and videos on this if you search the term.",1
"If you could, say, turn down the brightness of the Sun during the day to allow for other stars to shine, you'd see that the sun is in or near the constellation capricorn.

"Hey man! Sorry for the late answer, I somehow didn’t see the notification. Thanks a lot for all the details, that’s really cool of you. I’ve actually checked Astrobackyard and a few others, but as they sometimes give really different advices about the post-processing, I was unsure of which tuto I had to stick with. I couldn’t do much anyways without a reflex camera or other fitting imaging devices. I’ve just been able to get a short movie of Jupiter and a few moons with the GPCam but didn’t know what to do with it as I probably messed up the parameters, and it was quite blurry even when I tried to stack it. Felt a bit discouraged, and as I lacked free time, I delayed my apprenticeship for longer holidays.

I’m using a Maksutov-Cassegrain 127/1500 from Skywatcher! Wanted something compact and versatile that I could eventually bring with me, hence the choice of the AZ-EQ 5 pro mount which is moderately lightweight. I’ve been using it for a while now, doing planetary observation, but I still had astrophotography in mind so I made sure that gear could fit for a beginner in this domain. Got motivated with your pics and message, so I’ve just found a second hand Canon D1000 to complete the kit and make a good start!

And yeah, space is fascinating. I’ve always wanted to connect further with it. I made it my studies, but when I wanted to make it a hobby as well, the required gear costed a lot for a student. Observation is awesome, but astrophotography can show you so much more. After all, our eyes are imperfect instruments with a narrow spectrum. Finally could save up enough to invest in a setup that should last for a few years. I just have to find the time, and hop on the train, hahah. 

I’ll check out everything you listed there when my camera will be shipped, and hopefully I’ll be able to show pictures that’ll be half as good as yours after enough experience! Thanks again!",1
Wow it  a dolphin and it looks like a even smaller bolt on it face,1
"Often when watching the ISS in the summer time in clear skies there is a sudden major drop in brigthness, after which the ISS can still be seen, but much darker. I suppose the sudden drop comes from entering the earths shadow.

Regarding starlink: I was looking for starlink satellites some weeks after launch in July and even though the sats where in the sunlight binoculars where needed to see them.
So I suppose we won't be able to see starlink satellites with bare eyes in normal operation, just when their not in their usual orientation. Still the amount of satellites that need to be launched and replaced from time to time and those that start tumbling is probably high.",1

This target is officially known as Sh2-308, but I have always enjoyed the Dolphin Nebula.

"For this chart I'm using the Conti scheme of stellar evolution from the 1970s and the paper I used to refrence that is ""Red Supergiants and Stellar Evolution"" by Sylvia Ekstrom, Cyril Georgy, Georges Menet, José Groh, and Anahi Granada. I also used this somewhat old, but very handy dandy [site](http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/astro/HR-temp-mass-table-byhrclass.html) for the RGB colors, and bassically I took the subdivisions for each spectral type and looked up the mass (ie. ussually an average main sequence star below with a spectral type later than O8V will have had an inital mass somewhere below 25 solar masses, whereas an average main sequence star with a spectral type above O8V, will have initally formed with a mass somewhere above 25 solar masses), then took all those subtypes in the certain mass ranges, averaged each of the red green and blue values for RGB and used that average number for the average color of each star in the mass range. I had to do some guestimating with the red supergiant sizes, since red supergiants are stars that have lost of a lot of mass and thus they ussually range from 10-20 solar masses, but I think I have a somewhat good aproximation of the general sizes. This chart is also somewhat simplified, because there can be some cases where stars with inital masses 30-40 times the mass of the sun can go from RSG to WR, and stellar evolution can also depend of metalicity, but for the sake of simplicity and not losing my sanity in not being able to find a good source, I decided to leave a lot of that stuff out.

Because I am planning to include low mass stars similar to our sun and really low mass stars like red dwarfs, its going to be a bit of a challenge, because what I have done so far is to scale, but at true scale, you couldnt even see the sun, let alone a star 1/0th the size of it. I tried exponents, but the scale didn't look very good and the sizes of the stars were barley distinguishable, so I am trying to figure out a good work around",1
"I wouldn't be interested unless there were true-scale options for planetary size comparisons, otherwise i can't see this being useful in the slightest as an educational tool.",1
Absolutely stunning!. Which camera did you use?,1
"NOTE: The mass increase is from right to left. The rightmost is the evolution of a small high mass star like Mu Cephei, left to that is the evolution of an intermediate high mass star like Rigel, left to that is the evolution of a quite high mass star like Rho Cassiopeiae, and the leftmost is the evolution of a really really massive star, something like Eta Carinae, which stays small and blue for its whole, incredibly short stellar lifetime, since violently blows its outer layers as a wolf-rayet soon after birth, and thus is never able to expand and cool its outer atmosphere.",1
NOTE: The mass increase is from right to left. The leftmost is the evolution of a really massive star that can never cool enough to expand its layers and thus stays small and blue until it dies in a GRB hypernova or directly collapses into a black hole,1
That is a good point,1
"Yes of course. I’ve been doing lots of research on my own and I’ve been attending some courses at my local community college, I love solving problems and speculating. I hope I can contribute to science no matter how little",1

"I went on July 1st, and the Milky Way was highest at like 2 am",1
MY theory for dark matter is that extra gravity is not gravity at all - that the galaxies move too quick for their mass is prob because light moves instantly unless a gravity well is pulling it down - we only measured light in the suns gravity well and even here we can see the that light lags when there is a planet between the sun and us,1
"A nice idea though dark matter acts a little differently that normal matter.  For one thing, its diffuse, it doesn't clump up into stars and planets like normal matter does because it cannot radiate energy away through electromagnetic radiation.  Normal matter, as gravity pulls it together it get hotter which tends to make the gas want to expand.  Normal matter can cool down by emitting EM radiation allowing it to collapse enough to form stars.  

If dark matter really is just normal matter but in another dimension, that would apparently not include EM radiation, which is actually pretty important to how normal matter works, which would make it quite abnormal.",1

"Yes it's a pretty interesting one, but we're a pretty young planet, so I don't think it is because of the age of our home. I think the fact that we might be the product of a lucky and rare phenomenon is more relevant!
Added to this, I don't want to believe we're the first. I prefer the idea, even if it's sad in a certain way, that the universe is so big that we can't even reach our closest star without spending undreds or thousands years drifting away.",1
"Dark matter is made up for the expansion of the universe to have an answer. Imh, universe isnt expanding like science say it is, but rather expanding in therms of the mass actually moving away from each other, kind of like waves after you throw a rock in the water.",1

I’m just presenting the fact that gravity affects almost everything whether we can observe it or not,1

I really like the option that we may be way early compared to other potential civilizations. I’d never heard that one before.",1

"You put your camera in manual mode, and you control the focus, the ISO and most importantly the shutter.

You put the camera in bulb mode which allows you to keep the shutter open as long as you want.

Almost like those still photos you see of a waterfall where the water appears to be streaming across the photo. Or a shot of a freeway where all you see are streaks of light.

In this case you need the shutter open at least 30 seconds or more for deep space objects to capture the light they emit.

In order to do that you have to put the camera on a mount that tracks with the rotation of the earth.

Either an equatorial mount or a star tracker.

With the latter you have to frame the object yourself because they often don’t have a go-to feature. But It’s not that difficult with a little practice.",1

Awesome! I'll get right now!,1
Yes!,1
I`ll plead the 5th,1
"I agree with /u/ozmandias23 that the most likely one is that we simply aren't able to detect signals from other intelligences. Humans have found better communication methods that don't require blasting radio waves into empty space; presumably if any intelligent species exist then they also have stopped transmitting randomly into the cosmo, and listening for radio signals from distant aliens is a bit like trying to start a game of Marco Polo in a pool full of Deaf people: they don't know we're trying to get their attention so they don't know to look for a signal they normally wouldn't even detect.

However the one I kind of hope is true is that we are among the first intelligent species to evolve, and so we're just early to the party. There's something deeply romantic to me about it. We find a universe that seems cold and alone. We explore and settle the galaxy and still nothing. Then, suddenly, intelligent life, but at an earlier stage of our development. They're trying to build a society in a universe that seems cold and indifferent. They are alone, like we were. So we decide to go to them. We tell them ""we were alone, like you. We can be together now. We will teach you how to fly across the stars and settle planets, and how to avoid the mistakes we made. You will teach us, for there is so much we don't yet know. We'll find more like us, and then we'll go and meet them, together, and assure them that they are not alone. Because we were alone, and we struggled and suffered wondering if anyone in the universe cared, or was capable of caring. We called out, but no one answered; we choose to answer: 'we are here, we are like you, you are not alone.'"" 

Maybe unrealistic, but it's a beautiful dream I hope will come true.",1

If other intelligences follow similar patterns, it's not only looking for a needle in a haystack but more like looking for needle(s) in a haystack that appear and dissapear in a split second.

And yep, I know this galaxy with no black hole must one of the single but I am an amateur too.",1
"I have to admit, there's a level of pedantry involved here.

Black holes are still pretty much guaranteed to be necessary in galaxy formations, but there are theoretical ways for black holes to leave their nest, so to speak.

One would be another black hole coming in for the merge from an unfortunate angle, causing the resulting gravitational wave to kick the entire thing out of its galaxy. There are likely other theories but I'm just an amateur nobody, so this is pretty much the extent of details I can give about it right now.

Point is, if you pick a super strong telescope, and search the nightsky long enough, you'll find yourself looking at galaxies that don't contain black holes (anymore).",1
"  

This app is one of the coolest things I have seen lately.

Many times I have considered building by myself one solar system to scale, however it’s difficult to fulfill a compromise between planets sizes and distances between planets.

With your AR application that’s easy to do. So I would recommend some suggestion of upgrades/improvements:

1. Allow the arbitrary solar system scale the user decides to use. For example you can decide to make a 4km solar system, and the user would hike with kids/friends to find out were planets are. Doable using GPS function.

2. Opposite: decide the size of any given planet in centimeters/inches, and rebuild the solar system accordingly.   

3. Show orbit paths.

4. Add double stars systems also to scale.

5. Add exoplanets, there are plenty of databases around.

6. Implement in iOS

"Well it depends what you mean by ""practical"".  A lot of people would love an AR experience where you could better appreciate the scale of the universe.  It's kind of perfect for AR because it's so hard to do in real life.  Some guys in my town built a scale model of the solar system along a city bike path but it required years of negotiating permission.  Much easier in AR.  

I could also imagine an app where you stand at a high place (like a balcony or window in a tall building) and pick a point to be the ""sun"" and it shows you where the planet's orbits would be relative to a certain size ""sun"" at that central point. Perfect for AR.",1

The Whale Galaxy (NGC 4631) is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. This galaxy's slightly distorted wedge shape gives it the appearance of a herring or a whale. This galaxy is seen edge-on from Earth.

The Hockey Stick Galaxy (NGC 4656) is a highly warped barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici and is sometimes informally called the Hockey Stick Galaxy or the Crowbar Galaxy.

"**LIGO**

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Two large observatories were built in the United States with the aim of detecting gravitational waves by laser interferometry. These can detect a change in the 4 km mirror spacing of less than a ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton.The initial LIGO observatories were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and were conceived, built and are operated by Caltech and MIT. They collected data from 2002 to 2010 but no gravitational waves were detected.

The Advanced LIGO Project to enhance the original LIGO detectors began in 2008 and continues to be supported by the NSF, with important contributions from the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Max Planck Society of Germany, and the Australian Research Council.

"They are hard to detect because the effects we experience are extremely small. You need a very large event (like two black holes colliding) to have an effect large enough to detect. And even then, we need a measuring tool [4km long](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO).",1
"There's a whole hodgepodge of stuff going on in this thread.

First OP's clip with the hubble picture and the sound. All that is just a computer going ""oh this is bright and dense, I'll make this tone for galaxies that are this bright and this dense.  Oh this is dim and diffuse, I'll make a different tone for galaxies that are this dim and diffuse.""   The tones are not a representation of actual galaxy size or amount of radiation or anything like that.  Just brightness and density of things it sees in the picture basically


Second, I was replying to someone who was asking a question they *thought* was related to OP's post but was actually completely unrelated.  So you are absolutely correct about the difficulty and rarity of gravitational wave detection and when I mentioned using computers to detect gravitational waves I was simplifying the explanation so not to befuddled the person I was replying to anymore than they already were by getting into LIGO and how the waves are detected.

Not sure if you want info directly related to gravitational wave detection or just astronomy in general but if you're interested in this kind of stuff I highly recommend these channels.  They almost always post sources from their research in the description so you can end up going down some really awesome rabbit holes if you get the itch:

1.) Anton Petrov gives almost daily updates regarding new findings and research: 
https://www.youtube.com/whatdamath

2.) John Michael Godier is a science fiction author and on his channel he not only goes into the actual science but also into theory.  He interviews astrophysicists and people in the field too (also I like his voice) 
https://www.youtube.com/johnmichaelgodier

3.) SEA doesn't publish daily videos on his main channel but what he lacks in quantity he more than makes up for in quality. 
https://www.youtube.com/sea1997

Those are some of my favorites off the top of my head.  Again, check the description for sources if you're looking for something to read instead of just watch, there's some pretty amazing stuff.

Gotta throw these guys in here just because they're so damn informative and help to understand some of the chemistry that pops up in Astronomy.

"Yeah.  The audio file was based, almost surely, on a higher resolution version of the image, where the tiny speck that looks like a dim blurry speck in the video is a tiny bright dot in the original.

"Yep, the 130pds. Hmm, that does look like an appealing price. One of the main drawbacks to that combination however is just the size of the scope, it's quite a lot bigger than you may think.

"&gt;Since there is no sound to hear we instead use computers to detect gravitational waves

But isnt it true that gravitational waves are hard to detect. As far as i know, the LIGO which has been used to detect gravitational waves, has detected them on very rare occasions and for really really small instances? Im not well informed about them being detected and recorded to an extent where they can be used for converting them to sound waves using computers.

If so, that's really interesting. Detecting gravity waves for larger durations can prove to be a huge step in decoding space and time mysteries that still elude scientists!

"Without a computer to polar align, you're limited to the imprecise method of polar alignment with Polaris and a polar scope by hand. Moreover, after this shoddy alignment, you're bound to encounter drift upwards of 4 or 5 minutes exposure time. I took a couple photos past this threshold and found the direction that my setup was drifting, and adjusted my counterweight and azimuth to ""manually"" correct the drift alignment. 

It gets quite complicated especially if you're using a ball head mount and photographing away from 0° so it takes a bit of tinkering. I don't really like to rely on this method though and rather just be as precise as possible when setting everything up to mitigate drift.",1

"Well, for one - I worked at a world class astronomical observatory and wrote the software for one of our imagers.  So... I see the raw data produced by the sensors... I see where we are pointing our scope.  I see the final processed data.

It's all real.

Likewise, when I was at NASA (GSFC) - you could walk into any room (except clean rooms) and talk to the scientist who would be pleased as punch to show you his work, how it works, the whole shebang. 

And in a similar vein, my software at NASA was used for AOIPS, which was a satellite in geosynchronous orbit taking constant images of earth to study the water vapor.  We could zoom in from the entire planet, down to sea level (to study water vapor at all altitudes).

Nifty, full color consoles (this was quite a few years ago) with joy stick that you could use to set where the cameras were looking - though it took a few minutes for each frame to download.

Plus, our project was in the LANDSAT building - which of course was doing full color imaging of the planet.",1

"It's clear that this does not display nor playback the ""starts recorded"" as far as I can tell. A Galaxy is ""counted"" (whatever that means in this case) no differently than a foreground star. This seems to simply runs over each columns of pixels and displays the brightness (or similar) of the pixels of columns (which can be interpreted as a density). I'm more uncertain about the sound, but /u/Rodot is probably right: Map the ""density"" to audible frequencies and perform an inverse Fourier transform. I literally just displays/sounds the Hubble image in alternative ways that is very difficult for humans to understand. It brings no new insights.

"I don't think they are or can detect gravitational waves well enough to get that kind of data from this hubble picture.

I'm not sure what data they're using, maybe radiation intensity or galaxy type or maybe they're not using any type of astronomical data at all and it's just a fun thing to use colors to make tones, but it's not gravitational waves.

Edit:  op posted this below, they're just using image data: 
https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13061

&gt;Stars and compact galaxies create short, clear tones, while sprawling spiral galaxies emit longer notes that change pitch. The higher density of galaxies near the center of the image — the heart of this galaxy cluster, known as RXC J0142.9+4438 — results in a swell of mid-range tones halfway through the video.

"Not exactly sure in this situation how they're interpreting the data and converting it into an audible tone.  Could be color or a type of radiation, maybe they're just using pixel info from the picture and no actual astronomical data.

 But a good thing to remember is that just because you're seeing something in this picture that looks tiny it could just be something really really big, just farther away. 

 A big fat looking galaxy you can see easily in this picture may actually be far smaller in reality than one of the tiny dots because one of the tiny dots may be an even bigger huge galaxy, just farther away so it looks small.

Like the moon looks like the biggest thing in the sky because it's close but in reality it's far far smaller than all the stars you see around it in the night sky.

&gt;So in order for sound to travel, there has to be something with molecules for it to travel through. On Earth, sound travels to your ears by vibrating air molecules. In deep space, the large empty areas between stars and planets, there are no molecules to vibrate. There is no sound in space.



Pertaining to black hole mergers:

&gt;As the black holes spiral closer and closer in together, the frequency of the gravitational waves increases. Scientists call these sounds ""chirps,"" because some events that generate gravitation waves would sound like a bird's chirp.

https://youtu.be/QyDcTbR-kEA

------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR

**In very basic terms here's three things to know:**

1.) there is no sound in space

2.) black holes don't suck in gravity

3.) black holes, especially colliding black holes, make huge gravity waves. 

Since there is no sound to hear we instead use computers to detect gravitational waves.  Those waves are converted by a computer into sounds that our ears can hear since we can't hear gravity with our ears.  Hope that helps!

**Edit: in the case of OPs post they're really only using image density info to create sounds.  Small stars and compact galaxies make one type of tone and bigger more spread out galaxies make a different tone.  Nothing fancy or sciencey going on here, just a fun thing to listen to.  As /u/Rodot said below, you could do the same thing with a picture of a cat.**

When you don't have enough dimensions on graph so you use sound,1
How is this sound picked up? Is from gaseous debris that acts as a medium for sound to travel through like how we managed to record some sound from the sun when that solar flare ejected gas and it acted like a medium for sound? (Idk how true that is but that’s what i remember reading back when that whole “sound of the sun” thing was a trend.),1

"**Astronomical system of units**

The astronomical system of units, formerly called the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, is a system of measurement developed for use in astronomy. It was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 via Resolution No. 1, and has been significantly updated in 1994 and 2009 (see astronomical constant).

The system was developed because of the difficulties in measuring and expressing astronomical data in International System of Units (SI units).

Relate it to the speed of light (like how long does it take light to travel 1 AU). Go over how it starts to be less useful at greater distances and why we start to use light-years and parsecs.

Rule of thumb for me when doing deep space astro is to expose for as long as I can without trailing, and pick whichever ISO pushes the histogram in the image to about 1/3 of the way from the left. With stronger light pollution filters you might have to bump it up but try to keep it as low as possible to avoid added noise.

its not that bad, really. its not too hard to set up and also not that time consuming. Its usually the opposite - you have to hope for clear skies and ideally no moon.

I had a DSLR to begin with. I got the telescope new and the mount was second hand bought. I guess 2k euros, maybe a bit less. But its possible to start out with a lot less. I've started taking milkyway-shots with a DSLR and standard lenses which could get you going at about 300€ used.

"Yeah, it was a good scope and I enjoyed using it. It's great for viewing planets and the moon, but not much more. To mount a DSLR to it, you'll need a T-ring adapter and another adapter specific to the 5se, which I can't remember the name of. If you're at all thinking about progressing towards astrophotography of any kind, then I can't really recomend this scope. The mount just isn't up to the job for long exposure astrophotography. In the long run, it would be a better option to go for a nice equitorial mount.

But as I said, for planetary work it's good. The mount can however be a little shaky at times, which can knock the OTA out of view sometimes.

"Is your club a member of the Astronomical League?  They have lots of resources to help grow your club. Does the club have a website? I've put a link on ours to like and follow our FB page and it gets hundreds of hits a month and is a great way to post upcoming club events and activities. Here's our website https://www.centexastronomy.org

Also NASA has lots of public outreach resources and you can get lots of free stuff that can be used for educational outreach. The Night Sky Network is also good too.  

Having public events in high traffic areas like parks, movie theaters, or malls is also good. Due to the light pollution, hold these types of events when the moon is up as it's a great crowd pleaser especially during first quarter moon. Be sure to have a booth set up with info about the club and new member forms folks can fill out to join on the spot if they wish.  Also take advantage of any city wide events where vendors can set up booths like public concerts, etc. You'll prolly have to pay a fee to setup a booth but it will be worth it to show off the club to the public. You can set up scopes to look at the sun during these kinds of events. 

Hit up your local community college and talk to the science professors there (especially if they have an astronomy 101 class) and let them know your club exists and ask if there is anything your club can do to help out or offer to invite the class to your observatory for a special project the class might be able to do (some exoplanet observations can be done with surprisingly basic telescopic equipment). 

So now you have lots of new members with all this work you've done.  How are you going to keep them engaged within the club to ensure they stick around?

"The electronic polar acope itself does not need a motor, but your mount needs one. You don't need to pick up and move the mount to align it  there are altitude and azimuth bolts on the base of every mount that you turn to rotate the mount left/right and up/down so you can align it perfectly. The electronic polar scope is easier because it's basically a camera that uses plate solving to analyze the position of the stars to determine exactly where the celestial pole lies and shows you exactly how to line up your mount with it.",1
"You should write textbooks, great reply.",1
appreciated!,1
"haha, to me it looks more like a swan.",1
No problem!,1
"Awesome!

Sure, star trackers are excellent for astrophotography, especially with telephoto lenses! 

So, advice:

1. Polar alignment is key - With a star tracker and a telephoto lens, you'll want to make sure that your polar alignment is spot on. The better you get it, the better your images will be. You'll be able to expose for longer without field rotation and life will become easier. 
2. Integration, integration, integration! - Your integration time is so important for bringing up that signal to noise ratio. A DSLR is generally quite noisy, so you really need to hammer down some hours on all your images. I'm talking at least 2 or more hours for each image. Yes, you can definitly get something out of an hour or less, especially at a dark sky or with a fast lens. But processing will be that much easier with more time and you'll be able to bring out that much more detail, that much more colour and you'll be that much more happy with your image. 
3. Planning! - before beginning any session, make sure you have a plan for what you want to do! Going in without a plan, no idea what you want to image or what you're going to do can waste precious clear sky time - especially here in the UK! Choose a target before hand and make sure your equipment is ready. Get it balanced, aligned and take it out before it gets dark. Check your batteries are charged and everything is working beforehand. There's nothing worse than realising something is wrong after you've set everything up. 
4. And 4, make sure to enjoy the ride! - This hobby can get frustrating sometimes, even demoralising. But just know, that whatever problems you face can be sorted with persistence and enthusiasm. The night sky ain't going anywhere anytime soon, so take your time with the hobby and most importantly, enjoy it for what it is! 

And yes, for sure you could get a great picture of Andromeda with that gear! It's a massive target. I took a decent picture of it with a 200mm telephoto when I was first starting out, which was bewildering to me!

I hope this helps, feel free to ask me anything anytime; I'll be happy to help ya out! :)",1

Yeah, the altair GPCAMs are really designed for guiding or lucky imaging for planetary or even galaxies. What telescope OTA are you using currently?

Sure! I learned a lot of stuff alone from a YouTube channel called Astrobackyard. He does lots of tutorials and vlogs with technical details in them as well. He also has a website that hosts lots of informative information such as reviews, guides and galleries. Chuck's astrophotography is another great channel if you're into deep sky imaging with a dedicated mono camera. He provides all his technical details, which is really helpful for beginners who don't know what settings to use. Astrofarsography is a channel similar to astrobackyard, who uses a DSLR/CMOS for imaging and provides some good tutorials and vlogs. Dylan O'Donnel is another great watch, as he goes more into the technicalities of the cameras and the process behind his images (He's also pretty funny). Astroaddict is another channel that posts mainly vlogs and some tutorials, he has some great content as well. VisibleDark Astrophotography is a channel I discovered recently and he creates some excellent processing videos using pixinsight. He also delves deeply into his images, creates comparisons and all around has a great YouTube channel. David Aldrich is another good source for pixinsight processing, as he as an entire series just for processing. 

There's even more channels out there that I've probably forgotten to mention or have never seen before. But YouTube is a great place to go to for well put together, concise information. 

And one brilliant book I recomend is 'Making Every Photon Count'. This is a great book for beginners and really gives an insight to the hobby. It can also help you save money in the long run, since it gives good recomendations based off of what you want to do. 

And lastly, the community forums! They are full of extremely helpful people who'll be happy to help you out with any problem you may have. I once had a problem with my mount, asked on the forum and within minutes I got a reply and fixed it! Stargazers Lounge and cloudy nights to name a few are great forums to look at. 

And remember, what ever happens in this hobby, just enjoy it! You're looking at objects located millions of lightyears away, basically looking into the past. It's such a unique and mysterious hobby that really puts you into perspective, always remember that and you'll do well!

I hope this helps man, feel free to ask me anything anytime! :)",1

"Wonderful shots!

I’m also planning to start astrophotography, but didn’t find the time to setup everything and experiment with the tutos I’ve found. Astrophoto requires both gear knowledge and skills in image processing, so that’s double the work. I’m super curious about learning all that, but my studies are quite time consuming, and the weather/light pollution in my area don’t help much hahah.

Didn’t even put my scope on station yet, with the equatorial mount, as I’ve just tried basic GoTo and using azimutal position for now (got an AZ-EQ5 pro GT mount). I’ve got most of the required gear, even though I do lack a reflex camera. I might have done the mistake to think I could do that kind of picture with an Altaïr GPCAM2 (colour), but from what I saw there, most of the awesome pics were done with a reflex camera, using the Altaïr-like cameras as guides instead of imaging.

May I ask you what guides/tutorials you used when you first started? I’d really like to do such promising shots myself.

Thanks a lot, man!",1

"We do really need to spice up our monthly meetings since it’s the same format each time and only the same current members attend. Even a meeting discussing what apps are useful like you mentioned would be a good change of pace and probably attract new people. 

I’m in the U.S. and we are working on partnering with high schools and colleges so teachers can bring their students to the observatory and use our equipment as part of the curriculum. I love the idea of an extracurricular club but we’d need more volunteers before being able to do that. Thank you for the ideas!",1
Thanks so much! :),1
"This is a great resource. Technically we could use it for planning events and lots of other useful things so I was surprised when I found out we basically don’t use it for anything club related. I think it’s because we don’t currently have a volunteer who could dedicate time to managing it all and training our members on how to make accounts, etc. Hoping to change that this year!",1
"Anything you can see with your naked eye through a telescope, NASA has seen five times over. They do surveys of the entire sky with some of the largest telescopes in the world every decade which can peer hundreds of times deeper than anything us amateurs could ever have.",1
Absolutely stunning. Excellent work!,1
"Good point! Here’s just a little more backstory: Last year a new park opened in our town and it had pretty high attendance through the summer. One night we had about 4-5 scopes set up in a grassy area and tons of people stopped by while they were at the park. This was coordinated with the parks department but they really didn’t advertise or do very much on their part other than a Facebook event with a handful of people “interested”. We had coordinated similar events with them at other parks with very low interest/attendance but this last time we just lucked out and had lots of people stop by because they were already there for the new park. Also if we plan something formally in advance, half the time we have to cancel or get low attendance because of clouds or rain. That’s why I like the idea of showing up with a scope where people already are vs. planning at the risk of canceling or getting low attendance. A while back I saw a video of a guy that wheeled his scope around on city streets and let passers by look at the moon. A lot of them were seeing it up close for the first time. I really liked that approach because it literally brings astronomy to the public. But you’re right it does get tricky when you’re doing it as a private citizen versus a representative of a group so I’ll make sure we do it the right way.",1

"Hey there. Yes, the picture of the moon is a composite. I took an image of the moon by itself, then another image of the clouds surrounding the moon. I then combined the two in Photoshop using layer masking and tweeked it further to get nice colours and sharp detail. 

Thanks a lot!",1
"I use a combination of Pixinsight and Photoshop CS2 now. Pixinsight is for the majority of the processing, where I'll do the heavy lifting. Getting rid of gradients, noise reduction, deconvolution, histrogram stretch and curves adjustments. I use Photoshop to further enhance the colours, reduce the noise even more and add a touch of sharpening.",1
"Sure thing.

For the moon, I simply pointed towards it using the GOTO on my mount, took a video of the moon itself. Then, I took a seperate image that focussed the clouds. I took the video of the moon onto my computer and stacked it using Autostakkert. I then took both the clouds and the moon into photoshop and combined them into one using layer masking. I touched it up a bit with some curves and levels adjustments and colourised it to give a more blue tinge to the image. 

The process for deep sky objects is a lot longer. If you want me to explain that as well, feel free to ask :).

"Thanks a lot!

I've been doing astrophotography for a year and a bit now. That's cool!

I too started with that same telescope, and here I am now! If you own a telescope and it makes you buy a new one, it's done a good job. It shows that you're committed to the hobby and enjoy every part of it. Going for a better scope is just part of your drive to get more out of it. 

I worked my way up pretty slowly. I went from that 130eq to a nexstar 5se, then to a heq5 pro with some other equipment. But to be honest, I wouldn't completely recomend my route. I spent a lot of money on things I didn't need, because I didn't know what I was doing. I ended up reselling a lot of my stuff and losing some money on it. I think one of the best ways to just get into astro is to buy a small, portable tracker mount like the ioptron skyguider. People take some amazing images on them and they really have some excellent possibilities. Just take a look at the YouTube channel Astrobackyard! One of these small trackers paired with a DSLR and lens is a great combination for starting out. They're not too expensive and will give you a proper taste for the night sky.

Remember, take your time with the hobby, the night sky isn't going anywhere soon! Relax and enjoy it for the amazing hobby it is! 

I hope this helps, feel free to ask any other questions, I'll be happy to help :).",1
Do you mind shortly explaining the process?,1
"Oh that's a good idea, thanks!",1
James Webb.. can't wait!,1
"No problem, thank you!",1
"Thanks so much! I agree, everytime I take a picture of one of these it makes me wonder about the possibilities out there. The sheer vastness of space is incomprehensible, which like you, fascinates me. 

Hmm, I don't have any sort of cloud drive, sorry. That's something I should look at doing though! If you like, I do have a Twitter @JH_Astro where some of my images are posted.",1
"Thanks so much! I was 16 when I started astrophotography, now 17. For sure, it can certainly be affordable if you do it right! Starting out with widefield imaging is the least expensive and the easiest to get into. If you have any dark skies nearby, just go! Even if you have no equipment at the moment, it's good to get a feel for the night sky, get used to the temperature, the climate and the darkness. If you're just in your backyard, get used to that to! It's always good to do that before buying all this kit. Another recommendation I have is to buy the book 'making every photon count', it's a brilliant book you should read from cover to cover that will give you some insight to some of our technical jargon and the equipment we use. It'll also give good recommendations on how to start out. 

I hope this helps, feel free to message me anytime, I'll be happy to help you out anyway I can! :).",1
Absolutely beautiful images! Thanks for sharing! Happy New Year!,1
"Thanks a lot! If you need help getting started, feel free to ask :).",1
"Thank you very much! So, how I go into it: It all started for me with my Dad's old telescope i found up in the attic. I took this out on numerous clear nights, looking at the moon and being fascinated by all I could see. Until the inevitable happened, I wanted bigger and better! So I bought myself a Celestron 130eq, which was a great little scope for visual observation of planets and the moon. Where astrophotography all begun was when I started using my phone to take pictures through it, and I realized the amazing possibilities you could get from your own back garden! It all spiraled on from there and I bought a second hand nexstar 5se. This was my first GoTo telescope, which could track the night sky and really allow me to get into astrophotography more. So I bought a canon 600d and started taking pictures through it. I was baffled and amazed by what came out! I was imaging deep sky objects millions of light years away, from my back garden, I loved it. And as you can imagine, I kept on going from there. Buying new equipment, learning new skills etc. 

Some tips if you would like to get started in this hobby: For one, make sure to buy the book 'Making every photon count' it's a brilliant book for beginners that you should read from cover to cover in order to get a good grasp on some of the technicalities behind the hobby. You'll understand the jargon we speak and it gives good recommendations on how to start out. I made the mistake of not buying this book when I first started, really because I didn't know what I was doing lol. A lot of the time you'll find that the number one recommendation for equipment when you start out is to buy the best mount you can! The mount is so important, it needs to have a good payload capacity and be strong. The HEQ5 pro I use is relatively inexpensive, especially second hand and is sturdy. Next, a small apochromatic refractor is a good option. They're easy to use and basically plug and play with a field flattener. Something like a explore scientific ed80 or smaller would be great. The reason I recommend a refractor over the others is due to their easy to use nature, decent prices and overall beginner friendliness. And for the camera, a dslr to start with is a great option. All of these images were taken with just a canon 600D that had been astro modified for better Ha sensitivity. Even a 1000D is a good option and at a cheaper price. 

And remember, this hobby will be difficult at times, even frustrating - but remember, what you're doing is amazing! You're taking pictures of objects where their light is millions of years old, we're basically looking into the past.

I hope this helps! And sorry to have rambled on quite a bit haha. Let me know if I can help any more, I'll be happy to :)",1
Wow. That’s super cool. I would love to see some photos when you get a chance!,1
"Yep, a skywatcher 130pds to be specific! Well, the bottom right was with my older nexstar 5se.",1
"Yeah as the other two have said, it isn't random. I have an equatorial tracking mount that has GOTO capabilities. This means I can punch in any object I want and the mount will slew to it. I have lots of other software on my laptop to help with this, including planetariums, plate solving and more. And yep, that's andromeda! :).",1
"Thanks a lot! You definitely should, it's great fun :)",1
Thanks! It was something like 5202 x 3465.,1
"That's okay! I have some on Twitter @JH_Astro. If you want to stick with reddit though, there's some on here as well :). I might start posting to places like astrobin or flickr soon though.",1
I'll cross post.,1
"I made it primarily as a telescope. But I have a USB astrocamera I need to try on it.  I was just lucky to find the main lens in an antique store. Cost me US$75. The low f-value of 3.0 is what caught my attention. It originally had the rack for rack and pinon focusing on a Kodak slide projector. Look around junk shops and antique stores. I see things like this from time to time. My next project is to make a similar one using an f1.0 !! 8"" focal length lens it also got at a surplus store. I'm lucky I know a guy who owns a machine shop. He did the black anodized adapter and the white delerin mounts.",1
r/telescopes might be interested to see this.,1
"Sooooooo. I’m new here. Is this for use as a telescope or as a camera lens/telescope?  Either way, I want one.",1
"Awesome shots.

How long have you been doing this?, i am very new to the hobby after recently being gifted a telescope from my wife at Christmas.

Unfortunately, she bought me a Telescope, that even though i'm happy with it, is derided on here as a must avoid (Celestron Astromaster 130EQ MD), but she wasn't to know, and i don't have the heart to tell her. so i'm going to probably need to upgrade at some point.

I've looked on youtube for things like ""how to start out with Astrophotography"" and lots of these guys that do it regard a Starter setup as using mounts that cost £900 and scopes that cost upwards of £1000.

Did you upgrade incrementally, or just get everything as a job lot?",1
"This might be it, it looks similar, but I don’t know if my eyes are just getting tired of looking at it!",1
Is there anywhere I could find your photos without them being marred by Instagrams weird aspect ratio? I would love to have that moon shot and truth be told all of them as wallpapers if they're posted anywhere else and you'd be ok with it! If not don't worry I don't want to cause trouble.,1
"&gt;I got from other members made it seem like it was something formal that had to be arranged/coordinated

It's one thing if you're just a private citizen observing for yourself, and if someone *happens* to turn up and you show them something, and another thing if it's advertised or announced and is a club 'event'. It depends on local bylaws and who owns the the land, but it may well require at least informing the owner/administrator or asking permission if you don't want to get moved on. 

That said permission is almost always just a phone call or a quick form estimating time, date and numbers.",1
You should publish a calendar,1
The Moon pic is soo cool.,1

Just wait until the future space telescopes,1
"I don’t know much about astronomy or astrophotography, but I come here for the pictures anyway. Thank you for sharing.",1
"These are amazing. I find it's hard to describe how baffling the universe is NVM the actual mechanics.

"Thank you for taking the time to respond! I love the idea of setting up scopes in a local park. Our group partnered with our city’s parks department to do this once last year and there was a great turnout, but when I suggested doing it again the response I got from other members made it seem like it was something formal that had to be arranged/coordinated. I think it can be just as effective for a member or two to just show up at a public space with a scope and maybe some informational handouts, no planning necessary. 

I also like the idea of more hands-on workshops and events. Currently our monthly meetings consist of an hour long, pretty technical and information-heavy PowerPoint presented by a current member. It’s not the most exiting way for a potential new member to be introduced to our club and I can see a lot of people getting bored or intimidated by that and not returning.

The idea of loaning scopes is interesting too. I know the club has extra scopes and I think it’s understood among the more involved members that they can be borrowed, but I’m not sure that’s something we advertise. I’ll have to look into that more.

Thanks again for your ideas and input!",1
"I agree in regards to the reason why it’s mostly older folks. I think unfortunately a big hurdle is that people closer to my age just don’t have the time to volunteer.

"Oh no no with a motor for sure. I was tracking. Just not guiding ie with a separate guide scope on top of my imaging scope which helps maintain accuracy and can allow longer exposures.

Most equatorial mounts will come with a little scope built in that you have to kneel down and look through to align with the north star. Some don't come with it and you buy it separately. With either case you could get an electronic polar scope like I did and it hooks up to your laptop and makes it sooo much easier and more accurate as well.",1
Woah those are amazing! I love the moon one the best.,1
"How do i manually polar align my scope? I couldnt ever figure it out

"Actually you'd be surprised what you can get away with if you just have good polar alignment.

Prior to that, all other deep space pics were with a Skyguider Pro, unguided, with my scope and camera etc nearly hitting the weight capacity at about 10lbs. But, I installed an iPolar scope in it which totally changed the game and was actually able to pull close to 3min most nights!",1
Beautiful !!!. Your photos makes me wanna start astrophotography.,1
"During our public star gazing event, we start things off with a short slide show showcasing the club and informing people about what we do, how we do it and why, along with what folks benefit from by joining the club and volunteering.  We host several stargazing events in the area throughout the month at different places around town as well as at our observatory for the public to attend. During new moon weekends we have our members only star party. Often this might include a potluck dinner before sunset and a short lecture or slide show given by a member or guest.  During the summer months the club hosts Star-B-Qs during the member star parties where we grill hot dogs and hamburgers with all the trimmings and members bring a side dish or dessert.  This usually brings everyone out of the woodwork and we get to see members we don't otherwise see.  Our club is also heavily involved in  research. We have worked with Kepler and now TESS identifying and confirming exoplanets, many of our members work with the International Occultation and Timing Assocciation measuring the size and shape of asteroids, and during one campaign to measure a particular asteroid, two of our club members discovered an unknown moon around the parent asteroid.  A lot of our members do variable star measurements for the AAVSO and we have a long standing collaboration with the University of Delaware and University of Texas observing white dwarf stars which has resulted in numerous members being listed as co-authors on peer reviewed research papers as a result of their contribution.  We also rent our observatory out to the general public for a modest fee if they wish to have their own private star party. We have had scout groups overnight at the observatory, had family reunions come out for the night, wedding anniversaries and birthday parties, and the odd corporate gathering.  The trick to all this is you have to be visible to the public. During our public events we hand out brochures with details about the club and contact info if folks want to join.  Once a month we put a little blurb in the local newspapers to announce our monthly public stargazing events, we have a FB and Twitter account that we post to frequently. Our website will auto email reminders of scheduled events on our club calendar to all registered members.  We also are involved with the regional ISD and local ISDs and surrounding schools. We get asked to do star parties for the students and participate in teacher workshops to help teachers hone their knowledge about astronomy.  Our club also collaborates with the local colleges where students can do research projects or thesis work with our observatory.  As a result of all the work we do, this alone is often incentive enough for people to join.  

But truth told, astronomy is not a working man's hobby. I've been with my club since I was 25 and it has always been mostly retired folks who can afford the time and money to invest in this hobby.   I actually tried to join my club when I was about 13 but got discouraged because it was ""just a bunch of old folks"".  As long as the club remains active and visible to the public, it will survive without younger members since those younger folks will eventually retire and possibly join the club.",1

"Well Earth is a fraction of the mass of the solar system.

To take the Circinus molecular cloud as an example, it has a mass of 250,000 times our sun. If the sun is massive enough that its gravity causes huge amounts of nuclear fusion, then it seems reasonable that the gravity of a cloud 250,000 times more massive might have density fluctuations within that will collapse into stars.

Edit: you might find this simulation of a molecular cloud forming protostars interesting.

"How light is a feather? Can you lift it?

How about twenty thousand tonnes of feathers? Are those still light?

The thing that has to be understood is that stellar scales go well beyond our ability to comprehend. Gas creates pressure towards a center when one bit creates such a center. It does it in any scenario, but in the case of stars the difference is huge. And with no central body to orbit, it'll make one.

The answer you were provided reminds me about when I asked a high school math teacher about velocity. He said it requires calculus, which is so far out there we couldn't even cover the idea. At least that was the implication. Similarly, it really meant he didn't want go get into it.",1

What resolution do you have that moon picture in? It's amazing!,1
Alright that makes sense. Thank you so much :) now I wish i went took more physics courses lmao. Oh well. And thank you for the link too!,1
"That's the approximate acceleration at the surface, which is good enough for many purposes. The acceleration at the altitude of the ISS is about 8.7 m/s^2

Simple equations of motion become much more complicated if you require enough accuracy that you need to account for the varying acceleration due to gravity. If you take it even further its not constant across Earth's surface either.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid",1
Thank you so much. I understand now :),1
"Strictly speaking, gravity doesn't accelerate objects at a constant rate. When we say the earth's gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s² or 32 ft/s², that's just an approximation for objects near the earth's surface. On some mountain peaks it's about 0.5% less than it is at sea level (which varies too, of course). High in the atmosphere it's even lower (1-2%), for satellites and spacecraft in low earth orbit it's even lower (about 10%), and so on. The ""constant rate"" formulas only work over relatively short distances, like from the top of a skyscraper to the ground.",1
"Alright. So it's technically different, just negligible.",1
"So it's only constant if two things  drop from the same height? So when I would do experiments in my physics class when dropping two objects from different heights, the math was a little bit wrong? Negligible, I'm sure, but technically wrong?


 Also, if it is a different rateh why have we concluded it to be 9.81 m/s^2? Because we only tend to use objects close to earth?",1
"It is faster closer, but it is such a small difference that it is negligible in most cases.",1
"If you take the first point, then you should see that objects do not all fall at that same rate at all heights. We just say that because in our everyday life the gravitational acceleration is roughly 10 m/s^2. But if you go 10 miles up it’s different, same with 100 miles up etc. The moon is not under the same acceleration as us here on the Earths surface.",1
"Talk to local schools to see if they would be interested in you running an astronomy club for the pupils. Parents/schools love extracurricular activities but most schools have neither the right person nor the equipment to run a club.

I don't know which country you're in, but in some countries there are either exams or olympiads in astronomy (or both), and preparing kids for this could be a selling point for schools. Or if there is a community college maybe they would be interested in a partnership.

Also, take a good look at what you're doing in the montly meetings and stargazing. Are you doing all visual or are you doing astrophotography with digital cameras, digital processing, video? Paper charts or apps? To attract the younger audience you need to be up to date with the technology. Some will be happy with just visual but very few.

Have workshops on digital astrophotography. Show them how to use phone apps to navigate the sky. Use twitter/instagram to announce news, meetings, and just cool observations. Talk to them in *their* language.

And see if you can get guest speakers in for the monthly meetings, not just the same people.",1
"I understand both of those points, I'm just having a hard time understanding them together. Like, how is it a constant rate of change if the strength is stronger depending on how close you are. So, if drop a ball from 10 feet above the ground, it'll fall at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2 but also that rate from a mile or 2 above the ground as well? Why wouldn't the rate be faster from 10 feet",1
"The rate at which gravity accelerates something depends on distance and is not constant. Over small distances it may be approximated as a constant. 

Any two objects placed at the same distance will accelerate at the same rate.",1
"The force of gravity is proportional to the inverse of the distance squared between the two bodies. Thus the closer two bodies the stronger the force. 

Objects falling under Earths gravity experience the same constant force regardless of their mass, is that what you mean for your second point?",1
My son would love this app.,1
"I live in the UK, down south in a pretty light polluted town. If you're familiar with the Bortle scale, I'm at a 5/6. Check out 'clearoutside', It will give you a 1-9 depending on your location. 

You can definitely still get some really nice images even from a really light polluted place. Filters will be your best friend. Especially narrowband, they are the best way to go. If you're really wanting the best images, go for a mono camera with narrowband and LRGB filters. Or if you'd like a OSC (One Shot Colour) camera, there are multi-bandpass filters out there that just limit the bandpass to Ha, SII and OIII in one filter.",1
Just curious what part of the world you live in?  I live in a fairly metro area and done think I could get pictures nearly this good due to light.,1
"Yup, that's Andromeda at the top left. Thanks a lot! So the equipment I used for all but one image is a Skywatcher 130pds telescope, HEQ5 Pro tracking equatorial mount, altair starwave guidescope, altair GPCam1 guide cam and a Canon 600D. Not sure if you would've heard of any of these, but that's what I used. The bottom right image was taken with my older Nexstar 5se telescope, again mounted on the HEQ5 Pro.

Hope that helps!",1
What is your scope setup?  That (I assume Andromeda) picture is unreal.,1
"Ohhh i see, i didnt realize Nebulas gave off light almost exclusively in the hydrogen alpha wavelength",1
"Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, I'll be happy to answer them! If you'd like to check out some more of my images, or see processing details, check out my instagram @jh_astrophotography. Happy new year to you all!",1
Wow these are incredible,1
"Yes and no! You remove all the filters but you have to use other light pollution filters anyways. Yes, if you were to remove the filters inside the camera and then try to do photography just like that, all the stars will be bloated and there will be a red hue to everything. But I use light pollution filters that block out most light except for the red light given off by hydrogen alpha in nebulas. So essentially you're removing the filters in the camera that initially block the light you want, and then you use other filters to block out everything else BUT that light.",1
You have to stack it and decrease the exposure by increasing the shutter speed. You usually extract this from a video capture. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C94J9_WHlDk)  i made a while ago. I recorded how i did Jupiter in it.,1

How do you expose venus in a way that it comes out so clear? I've tried photographing it several times but it always comes out poor.,1
"Haha, you think clouds are bad? The smoke from the bushfires in Australia is really bad and you can barely see anything at night, yet alone during the day. Nice picture though, the moon never fails to amaze me (though I hate it when I’m observing DSO).",1
Shucks ... I have an iPhone.,1
"I'm thinking I need to start a youtube channel for tutorials and advice haha. Until then I will recommend any of Astrobackyard's videos on youtube, that's where I learned enough to get things started!",1
"Do outreach events. It’s the most effective way to get new members, and was how I got into astronomy. During the 2012 transit of Venus, a teacher or parent (I forgot) at my school had a telescope set up with a solar filter, and we could observe the sun and Venus. I was into space at the time, but not astronomy itself, but it was so cool and I was instantly hooked.

Head to a school, the local park, city centre, or anywhere where there’s lots of people. Show random people who walk by visually stunning objects such as the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Pleiades and other DSO with your scopes. This is a good way to introduce people to astronomy, something which they probably wouldn’t have done themselves. From there, encourage them to join your club. Maybe offer a discount for anyone who comes to an outreach?

If you aren’t doing so, I’d recommend doing stuff like interactive workshops based on things nearly everyone in the club can do. So maybe something like learning to starhop, or finding the whole Messier list. Maybe even dabble into niches such as sketching or electronically assisted astronomy. The best way to learn things is to actually do them instead of just listening to someone showing you how to do it. 

Also loan out your more expensive scopes, but only allow people who attend regular meetings to borrow them. Perhaps a points system or something. This provides an incentive for people to head to meetings, as they want to try out the fancy gear, and also ensures that new guy wont be touching your super fancy 11” RASA very soon (if you have one, at least), so you’d feel a bit safer. And make sure to keep a good collection of beginner scopes - some people can’t afford to buy a scope, but being able to borrow one would be amazing for them. And eventually they could try out more fancy gear.

Maybe at the end of the meeting or viewing night, ask everyone to fill out a tiny survey where they just describe whether they enjoyed that night, and what can be improved. This way, you can identify the potential reasons as to why you’re only getting the same people every time.",1

"There's slightly different kinds of modifications, but mine was a full spectrum mod which removes the red light and infrared/UV filters that come in factory DSLR's. A lot of the red light that comes from hydrogen alpha in nebulas falls within this wavelength which is blocked by those filters. Removing them essentially allows you to pick up on the full signal hitting the sensor.",1

How did they observe it before?,1
Hey bud! Just curious how you got started? I've been thinking about commuting to the hobby as I love going out with my pixel 4 and taking basic landscape astrophotos? From someone rather new I was just wandering for some pointers? Like cameras etc?,1
"Based on my reading [of this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy#Distinction_from_other_nebulae), it sounds like the notion of another galaxy came to be in the 18th century-ish?

&gt;In 1734, philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg in his Principia speculated that there may be galaxies outside our own that are formed into galactic clusters that are minuscule parts of the universe which extends far beyond what we can see. These views ""are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos.""",1
How  can you do this without interference from all the glow of city lights?,1
If you'd like to see image acquisition details for each of the photos you can check out my [insta](https://www.instagram.com/themattlukasik/) along with the rest of my gallery. It's been an amazing year learning about this hobby and I still feel like there is still so much left to learn. Very thankful for the amazing astro community which never stops surprising me by how helpful everyone is. Here's to all of you!,1
Thank you for the elaboration.,1
"The lowest pentagon is the main part of the Auriga constellation, with the brightest star being Capella (top left of the pentagon itself).

In the middle of the pic you have Perseus, almost the whole constellation, while above it there are parts of Cassiopeia (which you can recognize in the night sky from its W shape).",1
That is a pretty neat shot.  I have literally zero experience with any of that equipment or editing software so my shots probably wont be anywhere near that.  I'm just now starting to find the time to be able to do some photography.  Thanks!,1
"Sometimes learning a channel exists is awesome lol.  I'll check it out, thanks!",1
"Did they understand it to be another galaxy?  I know that Andromeda was definitely observed before the 1900s, but was just thought to be a nebula in the Milky Way.",1

"Mine too, Even as I improve I always want that perfect image of it",1
Thank you very much!,1
"No worries, it is confusing. The mount does track by itself, but often times people will use a guide camera and guide scope. 

Basically the camera will use a star as a reference to make sure the tracking is extremely accurate, allowing you to take very long exposures.

I just wasn’t doing that in this case.",1
350mm focal length. Magnification applies more when you’re using eyepieces through a telescope.,1
May I ask how much magnification was needed for this?,1
My god that's an amazing shot. Fantastic work!,1
A mount only does tracking by itself. Autoguiding is a different thing.,1
"First, let me say how amazingly breathtaking the image is.

Second, I have a question: You say unguided but just a little bit below you're saying you used skywatcher EQ6 R Pro Mount? I mean, doesn't that make it a guided image? Sorry I guess I'm just confused with the terminology, and I thought we can take image like this without a mount.",1

"Exposure isn't necessarily continuous, you can do a few hours one night and then a few more the next and so on, using an motorized equatorial mount to counter Earth's rotation.

Check out the book Turn Left at Orion and the program Stellarium.",1
"Exposure is the amount of time the camera lens is open for. 

To take pictures of deep sky objects you take many long exposures and use software to stack them together.

When you're doing long exposures astrophotography you need an Equatorial mount that moves with the rotation of the Earth and always stays centered on the object you're photographing. Good eq mounts cost many more times than the telescope itself usually. We also use smaller telescopes as 'autoguiders' which make micro adjustments to the eq mount to make sure everything is smooth.

No you don't need a dedicated astronomy camera. You can use an adapter and an everyday DSLR.

Astrophotography is expensive. Unless you have a few thousand dollars spare better to stick to plain old visual astronomy.

For finding objects visually we use a technique called starhopping. In a nutshell this is bouncing from a really obvious easy object or star to a nearby one, and another, and another until you finally find the object you're looking for. 

A good book like *Turn Left At Orion*, and a good app like *Stellarium* make starhopping easier.

It also helps to have either a Telrad or a magnified finderscope or both. These help you to point your telescope in the general ballpark of whatever you're searching for.

To use the eyepieces in a scope to find objects. First use your widest angle lowest magnification eyepiece (it will have a higher number like 32mm or 25mm). Then when you've found your object pop in increasingly higher magnification eyepieces (increasingly smaller numbers eg. 15mm --&gt; 10mm --&gt; 6mm etc.) Until you find a view you like.

Hope that helps answer most of your questions.",1

3. There are apps you can run on your phone to locate astronomical objects.,1

"Hey, /r/Astronomy,

I recently became interested in the surface of Titan. I am writing a short sci-fi story revolving around Titan, and I wanted to make sure I didn't make any huge mistakes when mentioning places and surface features of this fascinating moon.

So, I looked for the most detailed map of the surface:

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22770

However, it was lacking surface features and a grid to be able to know the coordinates of a point on the surface. I found another map:

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20713

But the grid wasn't accurate enough for my needs, and it was using older images of Titan's surface. I also found this 3D model (glTF) by NASA, using the aforementioned older images of Titan's surface:

https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2347/titan-surface-3d-model/

Hence, I decided to create a map that would fit my needs. With the aid of Photoshop, I started counting pixels to create the grid. Separation between meridians or parallels is 7.5º. I also labelled all surface features mentioned in:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Titan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_of_Titan

Some coordinates were wrong in the Wikipedia, and I have corrected as many as I have detected, but there might still be some errors in the map due to this.

**Here is the folder with all the maps and 3D models I have created or modified for download:**

https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ve39jhk1t95v0/Titan

Just as NASA did with their maps, I am releasing these to the Public Domain, in case there is interest of any type.

The *.glb models can be viewed by downloading them and uploading them to a site such as this one:

https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/

Any comments appreciated.

Happy new year, /r/Astronomy",1
"**Shape of the universe**

The shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy.

Cosmologists distinguish between the observable universe and the global universe.

"FUN FACT: It was seeing Venus in a phase like this one that was the death of the geocentric theory. In the Ptolemaic model, Venus would always be closer to the Earth than the Sun, meaning it could never be more than half full at night.

To salvage Ptolemy, sorta, Tycho Brahe proposed that Mercury and Venus orbited the Sun while everything else orbited the Earth. That was acceptable for a while - and didn’t require rewriting known science and official theology - until Newton derived orbital physics 80 years later. Without an understanding of why things orbit, there’s no reason Tycho might not be correct.

In this simulation, you can actually click and descend into the various solar systems; in the solar view, the stars are ""realistic.""",1
"The stars in your video are ""plus"" shaped whereas they should be round.

In astrophotgraphy (e.g., Hubble) you see this effect (diffraction spikes) when you image through a telescope which has a secondary mirror suspended by spider vanes. In a refractor (e.g., the human eye or any other non-obstructed telescope) the stars are all round.",1
"What makes you think the universe has any shape at all?  It implies there is an ""outside"" to view it from.  You could try to measure it from within but since space itself is non uniform you can't be sure any of your measurments are correct.

So what exactly is it in the picture? The bright spot to the left of the aurora?,1
Io is also the source of much of the ambient plasma around Jupiter. It's putting out like 1ton/sec from its volcanoes into its orbit.,1
"No problem, mistakes are happening to all of us. I love space stuff and especially these hyperdetailed photos. 👍🏻",1
"Io is moving through Jupiter's magnetic field, and so experiences an electric field.  Current flows to/from Io along magnetic field lines, through the ambient plasma, down to where it makes contact with Jupiter's ionosphere.",1
"Also, Io is currently volcanically active, and its surface is always changing, there are many, many, small volcanoes and volcanic pits present, but no major volcanoes, nor any supervolcanoes on the moon",1
"You are right! I'm so sorry about that, I corrected it. Somehow I typed it correctly on [my instagram](https://imgur.com/a/m4cyrxl)though. Thanks for pointing it out!",1
"Not sure why you tied in Io’s volcanism into the aurora, but an aurora is caused by high energy electrons and solar particles emitted via the solar wind being directed to the north and south poles by Jupiter’s strong magnetic field, where the electrons excite gas particles, making the glow a bright blue (and ultraviolet)",1
"The comment before yours is misleading. The large ring-like auroras are caused by particles from the solar wind interacting with Jupiter's upper atmosphere along magnetic field lines.  
  
Io's entire surface is covered with volcanic activity that we believe comes from tidal forces heating the moon's interior. Io orbits close enough to Jupiter that it interacts with the magnetic field, creating the bright spot-like aurora seen on the left of the ring-like one.",1
"1.9 million km for Venus is a bit close, I thought Venus closest approach to earth is somewhere around 40-50 million km.

Other than that, great photo",1

The Moon was about 400.000 Km away during this shot, while Venus was about 1.9 million Km away. The Moon's diameter is 3,474.2 Km, while Venus's is 12,104 Km, so you can have an idea how big Venus is compared to the Moon (almost 4 times the diameter!)

"Chopin, Op. 15, No.1 in F Major!",1
Thanks for posting - never heard of this one. It looks great - like my Questar ‘scope. Too bad Its not shipping outside US.,1
Here i can barely see bright stars like the orion constellion and i have no GoTo control so i have to see the big stars,1
I mean most of these are from bortle 7. It’s been dummy clear for me this last year.,1
Meanwhile i got clouds everytime i went somewhere outside bortle 8,1
yeah i posted it there,1
Are you on the telescope discord? I think I saw that there,1
"I also recommend turn left at orion as the other person suggests.     


With eyepieces you generally want to upgrade atleast a little bit from what comes with the scope.   The cheap ones that everyone recommends are gold lines or  red lines.    Typically when you upgrade eyepieces, the image quality does improve, but not that much.   Most of the image quality improvement is seen near the outside of the field of view in your eyepiece where chromatic aberration is most apparent.   This is when the object you are looking at gets a little fuzzier and discoloration can be seen.   Typically for most decent eyepieces chromatic aberration isn't too noticable when you center the object in your field of view.",1
I appreciate the info! Sky conditions tonight were incredible and I didn't have any issues looking at stars like Sirius using the 6mm in conjunction with the barlow.,1
"I'm a Canadian Science(astronomy,chem,physics )student year 2, I found I got into astronomy with the 
-Jovian moons
- a h-r diagram 
And interstellar travel ( this may be harder to integrate) 

 I found the Jovian giant moons crazy fascinating. Titan with its atmosphere and liquid at it's surface was interesting plus ever changing Io was cool to study 


The HR diagram was interesting to see the life span of stars conpared to the luminosity and how to see how hot stars can was wye opening 

And with interstellar travel you can have some fun with. 
Lots of videos of thought experiments on how the human race could feasibly get to say Centuri C can be fun for students

Thanks for reading! :)",1
"You will certainly want to get a lower power eyepiece like a 25mm. It will help with finding things and give you a nice wide field of view. Be sure to line up the red dot finder with an easily identifiable object in the eyepiece either in the sky or a distant radio tower before you start observing for the evening. While you may not have to do it often, learn how to collimate the scope so it will give you the best image possible. For now, leave the Barlow in its case.  The only time you will really use it is for planetary viewing but the atmospheric conditions have to be excellent and this will be rare. Get a good star atlas and learn to star hop. The book ""Turn Left at Orion"" is a great place to start.  If there is an astronomy club near you, join it. It will be you biggest resource and asset in learning the hobby. I've been with my club for 25 years and I'm still learning things from my fellow members.",1
Wow good work! I love how it shows so clearly the difference of titan with the other moons of Saturn.,1

"My KSP experience tells me that A&amp;C are impossible, and that something resembling B&amp;D are possible (assuming there's not some super-tiny incorrectness in those that is too small to discern without numbers)",1
I personally disagree with you there but I guess we won't know without an update from OP.,1
yeah I did mention to OP that without given values it’s hard to say for sure but I do think that’s meant to show a circle.,1
"At this scale it's not possible the say that the eccentricity is equal to zero on D - it could be very slightly elliptical (ie eccentricity of 0.01 or 0.02, like earth), and you wouldn't be able to tell.",1

Is this part of your homework assignment?,1
"The funny thing couple of days ago a thought came to me (a recurrent one) about witnessing a close supernova in our lifetimes. Then suddenly Beetlejuice is all over the news, so who knows maybe the universe will be fulfilling my wishes soon.  At the same time it still may need thousands of years to reach that point. So don’t worry and enjoy the night sky.",1
"A and C, assuming the diagrams are drawn from above.

If the disgram can be tilted, then onl, A.",1
A and C -  Kepler's law says (if I remember correctly) that an elliptical planetary orbit has the star at on focus of the ellipse.  Orbits A and C do not seem to meet the condition.,1
D bc all orbits must be elliptical and have eccentricity greater than 0. A circle has 0 eccentricity.,1
Yikes!,1
"I don't know why I feel kinda sad when I hear that beetlejuice will go supernova any time soon, imagine look at the sky and see one of the stars missing. 

But at the same time would be exciting to see a supernova so close to us",1
"Yes. It is all over the news.

It is due to two main intensity cycles hitting lows at the same time.

Or, it will be going supernova any day now.",1
I have never taken an astronomy course but I would say that A and B are wrong. I just googled Kepler’s Laws and I think that they violate his second rule. If you were to draw a line through the middle of the star then them both sides would not be equal.,1
"A, Because it looks wrong. Does that mean I’m from space?",1
A,1
"Can you involve a local astronomy club and begin the course with a star party?  It's one thing to see the pictures in a book and know those objects are far away, but it is completely different to see the objects yourself through a telescope and begin to grasp some of the distances involved.

Perhaps, on that night, you have the kids just write down questions that they naturally think to ask about what they are seeing and then those will be answered during the course.  In this way, the kids help make their own curriculum.  How many other classes do that?  The kids will be answering their own questions, rather than just being told information someone else says they should know.  Of course, you'll present additional material.

I'm sure once they see these things with their own eyes, they'll wonder how nebulas form, how long Jupiter has had the Great Red Spot, what Saturn's rings are made of, how far away the nearest galaxy is, how many stars are in a galaxy, why is that star red, and so on.

Each time they learn the answer to their questions, they'll immediately be tying it to something they've seen for themselves.  And when you teach them, you'll be able to start with ""Remember when you saw..."" and their minds will begin to engage.",1

"As a career developer, I do understand how open source works - everything you're saying is true, but I'm just not ready for or comfortable with making my project open source right now.",1
"Just FYI: A lot of personal passion projects are open source, and don't have to involve other people working on it or making changes.

A large idea of open source software is that *I don't have to rely on you creating executables*, because I'll have the capacity to do it myself after making sure that I trust the source code.

Of course, what you want to do with your software is completely up to you, but if you were so inclined, here are some obvious advantages:

* Ideas and discussion from the community: Someone reviewing the code can suggest ways to improve performance or solve problems that you've been breaking your head on. Something incredibly useful for the kind of project you're working on.
* Attribution: Making a project open source believe it not actually prevents theft because there is a recorded log of credited authors. These even hold up in court. Copyleft has long been a thing and even absolves you of responsibilities resulting from someone else's misuse.
* Feedback: People on Reddit telling you how the video of your software looks is great, but it doesn't compare to someone else telling you how the software works and what in particular worked/didn't work for them.

There are many, many solo personal projects on Github, and I'd wager they'd all agree that it's not at all like having someone else come in and write music for you.

If I may, it's more analogous to writing the entire piece yourself, but open source is the stage and the few people who showed up for your practice rehearsal the day before your actual performance.",1
Absolutely stunning!!,1
"I am not comfortable with people working on my software right now.  The software is still in such a young state, and also it's a personal passion project of mine.  It'd be like someone coming in and writing music for me or finishing a painting for me.  It's just not what I want to do with the software.  I fully intend to create executables for people to play with at some point, but I'm not intending to make the software open source.  And I think that's perfectly okay",1

The lights that were in a line were not connected to the shooting star. The shooting star went horizontally through the sky and the line of lights were vertical,1
Possibly it shed material as it went through the atmosphere and that was the lights? Is it burned up all the pieces eventually went their own direction.,1

Like, neutrino detectors aren't that interesting by themselves, but why it was important is (the whole we arent getting enough of these in our readings is the sun dying thing).

I decided to make a composite of some of my favorite photographs from this last year. Although I've shot around 90 different images, most of them are some of the more ""boring"" star clusters. I'm hoping to finish up photographing the entire [Messier Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) by next summer, as [I only have ~15 objects left to shoot](https://i.imgur.com/XnTBVNU.png). The 8 images in this composite represent **103.5 hours of total exposure time**, most of which has been from the roof of my light polluted apartment. According to my spreadsheet I have close to 370 hours of total exposure time across all of my images for 2019. Getting my setup almost entirely automated early this year really helped me take advantage of every clear night I got. I have links below if you want to check out the uncropped original photos, as well as their specific acquisition and processing details[.](https://i.imgur.com/zBrZtOZ.jpg)

---

A few commonly asked questions about my photos:

**How do you take long exposures of the sky moves?**

* I use an equatorial mount to [track the movement of the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYkY_JYfKlY) and take long exposures without the stars trailing. I also take several hundred shorter exposures (~5 minutes each) and stack them together to create one single image that then goes onto post processing.

**Are the Colors Real?**

* Most of these images are in false color, however images 2, 6, and 7 are considered to be true color (although our puny eyeballs alone will never be able to see color in these objects, even through a telescope). The false color images are somewhat close to true color however, with hydrogen gas being mapped more to red, and oxygen being mapped more to blue. I use a black and white camera, and have to take images through filters which are then mapped to RGB channels in order to produce a color image.

**What is your light pollution/How do you deal with it?**

* Most of these were photographed from the roof of my apartment, which is under Bortle 7 light pollution (9 being the highest). Images 2, 6, and part of 7 were shot from the Deerlick Astronomy Village, which is under Bortle 3 light pollution. In order to deal with the light pollution I use narrowband filters which only let through specific wavelengths of light (the specific wavelength that these nebulae emit) and block out almost all other light. It is possible to get good photos without using any kind of light pollution filters, and I've found a lot of the messier clusters are great targets for heavy LP and/or full moon nights.

**Pert II:**

Marvin del Cid, a journalist with Diario Libre, considers himself to be ""just a small link in this whole chain of people and events"", and understands that the December solstice event was ""like a mandate"" to name the stars assigned to the Dominican Republic. For him it is ineffable what he feels, after the names he suggested, through the project 'Name Exoworlds', were chosen to designate universally and forever a star (Márohu) and its exoplanet (Boinayel).

**A new approach**

Archaeologist Domingo Abreu understands that the findings in these caves ""pose a new approach to Antillean archaeology, based on the cave manifestations"".

""So far, archaeological studies have been based on material remains found: complete vessels, idols, fragments, pieces of bone, clay, shell and, mainly, on the Arawak trail. However, we have found in this and other caves the Mayan, Inca and Nahua trail, which makes it necessary for us to take a new approach to archaeological study in the Caribbean area,"" Abreu said.

**The Astronomical Leap of Taino Civilization**

- In the Cueva del Puente, every December solstice, there is an event that invites to revalue the Taino culture

- Today the country has two bodies in the universe named after the original inhabitants of the Caribbean

Henry Hidalgo - 30/12/2019

The sun's rays descend to the base of the cave where the Taino deities Márohu and Boinayel are engraved. (MARVIN DEL CID)
OP Photo

Until a few weeks ago, Márohu (god of clear weather) and Boinayel (god of rain) rested in the stillness of the Cuevas de Borbón or Pomier Anthropological Reserve, in the province of San Cristóbal, sculpted specifically in a stalagmite from the Cueva del Puente.


Fray Ramón Pané wrote about these two deities of the Taino culture at the end of the 15th century in his ""Report on the Antiquities of the Indians"", a compendium that has been considered the first work written in the New World in a European language.

In his account, Pané emphasizes that, for the natives, the Sun and the Moon came out of this cave, -called Iguanaboina by them-, and that Márohu and Boinayel were two cemíes who enjoyed ""much esteem"" because when the rains did not present credentials, as the Tainos told Pané, they would turn a visit to the cave and it would immediately rain.


Friar Ramon Pané himself described the cemíes in careful detail: ""[...] made of stone, small, the size of half an arm, with their hands tied, and they seemed to be sweating"".

**A unique find**

For a little over forty years, Dominican archaeologist and speleologist Domingo Abreu has been inspecting the Cueva del Puente, and in one of his visits, he noticed that Márohu and Boinayel were practically untouched by the sun's rays that gradually penetrated from the top to the depths of the cave.


Travel underground to see the Taino New Year at El Pomier
Everything changed forever when Abreu decided to go to the cave at a time of the year when the sun's rays reach their greatest inclination towards the south, specifically at the December solstice. 
The find was surprising: Márohu and Boinayel, the cemíes who remain in the shadows for months, were touched at their base by sunlight after one o'clock in the afternoon on December 21st, in what is now considered a unique astronomical-anthropological event.

**From the stillness to the stars**

This link of two cemíes with the solstice, the sunlight and the undeniable connection of the Tainos with their natural environment, served as a support for the journalist Marvin del Cid, who together with Domingo Abreu had visited the Cueva del Puente on the solstices of December 2017 and 2018, proposed, at the beginning of last November, to Márohu and Boinayel as names for the star WASP-6 and its exoplanet WASP-6 b, through 'Name ExoWorlds', an initiative of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

And so it was that the god of clear weather and his twin, the god of rain, ""abandoned"" the Cueva del Puente on the morning of December 17, 2019, when the IAU announced through its social networks that both had been selected, from the 618 proposals received, to officially name two bodies of the universe in representation of the Dominican Republic.

Four days after the selection of the Taino deities by the **International Astronomical Union**, Diario Libre went once again to the Cueva del Puente, together with several people who were involved in one way or another with the initiative of naming a star and its exoplanet in the country, to document with them the event that took Márohu and Boinayel up to the sky.

""The fundamental value of this cave is to have the greatest amount of pictographic manifestations of Inca ancestry, which is totally different from what appears in other caves. Here we have Inca symbolism, like the condor, and there is, naturally, the representation in one piece, in one stalagmite, of Boinayel and Márohu"", said Domingo Abreu, who witnessed for the first time the effect of sunlight in the cave and documented it together with Marvin del Cid for the third year in a row.

For Dominican astrophysicist Mayte Vasquez, the key person before the IAU to have an exoplanet and its star assigned to the Dominican Republic, it was ""very impressive"" and a ""unique experience"" to contemplate the December solstice event in the Cueva del Puente. ""To see at one o'clock in the afternoon how a ray of sunshine is approaching, (which) illuminates the feet of the cemíes, because it is a unique connection to our ancestors,"" said Vásquez.

In the words of the president of the Dominican Astronomical Society, Manuel Grullón, ""it is incredible to see and understand that the Tainos had or could handle, through their observation, this kind of event and that they honored in this cave those two cemíes that they venerated"".

"I think at the size you've got the planets, some of them would be over a mile away from each other. There's a *LOT* of space in space",1
Can you please share what tools you use for programming this seemingly cool app?,1
Basic dobsonian mount. With a 2x Barlow and my mirrorless camera (not sure what the equivalent focal length is of the camera sensor) the station fits pretty easily in a frame so after some practice tracking isn't impossible. And it's also a game of taking as many shots as possible. ISS visible in 50 out of 250 images is still victory.,1
Yes! Put all of the moons in there,1
"Nice pictures. Really cool iss shot too. 

Are you on a basic mount or goto? I have a 10in Sky-Watcher on a goto that I'm trying some limited short exposure photography with (stacks of &lt;30s exposure). Limited success so far.",1
Please don't release this until you scale them accurately. The amount of people not knowing the right sizes and distances is too damn high.,1
Sure! It's stunning. Idk if there's anyone who wouldn't want it.,1
Only if it's 1:1,1
"Unfortunately there are already a number of apps which do this. I think it's a great idea, but I have found 3 or 4 apps that do the same for free when I did market research for the same idea. I ended up pivoting and doing planetary formation simulations for research instead.",1
"No tracking, I just have a dobsonian mount. That's why I can't get anything like nebulas that require long tracking periods. 

For the geostationary satellites in the lower left they don't move so no tracking is fine.

ISS it's manually tracked with a fast shutter speed. Software called PIPP looks at all my images and if something is there it centers and crops it, so the ISS is kind of tracked in post processing

Planets are also manually tracked but that's a little more manageable with some practice",1
NASA images are public domain... Find what you need  and make it seen.,1
Yes looks awesome good job ;),1
My 4 year old would love this!!!,1
"looks great, are you using a tracking setup for this?",1
Be great on large scale for teaching !,1
Higher resolution models would be good,1
"All I know is, he left the house to exercise with his app - and right when he reached Jupiter a grizzly ate him",1
My kids would lose their shit I'd they had this,1
looks quiet cool. i would use it if you programm it in a way so that i can see their real proportions.,1
yes,1
"Make scal optional? With descriptive headings and all the stories, details, stats available in a dropdown menu.",1
You did it with ArCore?,1
That's the best thing I've ever seen and if I still had coins I would give you an award. I would love to see it being released as an app and would volunteer to be a beta tester!,1
"Idem, pleas e add some famous stars or black hole for reference",1
Damn that's so nice dude.,1
"Just curious, roughly how long would it take to make an app like this? Assuming you don't have a big team of people behind you.",1
"I'm not OP but ""The Greenbelt"" in Boise has this",1
THAT IS AMAZING!!! I answer want this.,1
"&gt;  And it’ll double as a fitness app!

K, now I’m imagining skipping over orbiting planets.",1
"Yooooo, put the sun too!",1
"Yes, most probes have used planetary slingshot/gravity assist to get them to their destinations. Most used it to increase velocity, reach greater distances and be able to meet the planet in the correct orbit on less power. But the Messenger probe destined for Mercury actually used it to slow its approach to achieve orbit. 1 flyby of Earth, 2 flybys of Venus, and 3 flybys of Mercury before finally arriving at Mercury in March 2011 with a velocity low enough to permit orbit insertion with available fuel.",1
Will do,1
"I've had a couple people ask about my TED Talk, here's the link: youtu.be/_NmGGXO69iE
And if you're interested in my music here is the link to one of my songs: youtu.be/fphAMl-1Z88",1
Absolutely,1
Tony Knowles ftw. Sun's behind the PAC tho. Light speed walking scale.,1
That top one do be looking like a kirby boss tho,1
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist,1
Thanks for the reply 👍,1
Hell yeah I would,1
"Very cool! IMO AR is a long way off from anything I’d use, but this app would definitely interest me. If you could fly around and watch missions in real time, that would be great.",1
"Yes, it is possible. I believe that method was used on Cassini or Voyager I or II.",1
This is probably worth a read https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk,1
I'm planning on getting it in the store asap. I think people are really going to like the final product,1
"You absolutely have to use a ""tracking tripod"" (known as an Equatorial Mount) to take exposures longer than a few seconds at focal lengths like these. You could get away with 20-30 second exposures untracked, but you need a wide angle lens, and even then, it's really only good for the Milky Way and the largest constellations.

Astrophotography is a very expensive hobby, and a decent setup will cost way more than what your telescope is probably worth. Contrary to popular belief, the most important thing in astrophotography is not the telescope or lens itself, but rather the mount you use. You want to get a good mount to accurately and stably hold your camera and telescope/lens whilst it tracks the stars. Beginner mounts capable of holding a telescope or telephoto lens start at about $1000 USD with the Orion Sirius or HEQ5, but if your just using a DSLR and short lens you can get what OP got, the Skywatcher Star Adventurer for about $400-500.

Then you need to factor in a camera itself if you don't have one, and the actual telescope/lens you will be using. For beginners, you'd ideally want a nice apochromatic refractor or quality telephoto lens (though I wouldn't recommend buying one unless you already have one, because they're expensive) and the appropriate field flattener. Some people use reflectors, but refractors are easier to use and offer a much wider FOV. Apochromatic refractors start at about $450 (William Optics ZS61, Apertura 60EDR, Astrotech 60AT, etc), but can easily be 5x or even 10x that. Then you need to get a field flattener for said telescope, which will run you about $200. So in total, thats about $1850 USD for a kit **without** a camera, guiding system (which you'll eventually want), filters, and other necessary accessories.

As you can see, it's a very expensive hobby. But you can use a DSLR and tripod alone, but don't expect to get images like what OP got.",1
I programmed this. It's not an app yet but it will be,1
Plus a comet would be dope for added walks. Trail behind it and follow it's journey.,1
"Id use it just for the heck of it, it's pretty awesome..

But have you thought about the kind of traffic youd get if you did Scifi planetary systems..


Endor and the 2nd Death star. Coruscant. etc..",1
That is amazingly awesome!!,1
That's awesome. I'd probably use it.,1
"Please do, and let us know where to find it!",1
Super app! Scale distance to reality might be tricky though..,1
I would pay good money from that.,1
I want to be able to throw them around like beach balls. Is augmented reality interactive yet?,1
"Oh my God, that is so cool!

Then again, I’m the nerd who bought both Theodore Gray’s “The Elements” app (I also have the book - both are fantastic!) AND his “Molecules” app, so I might be a bit biased.😁",1
"Absolutely, this is great.",1
Famous last words ^/s,1
I love the idea of just taking a class of students on a walk from one end of the solar system to another while actually being able to track progress/scale in the app,1
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes,1
This is so cool! Heck yes I'd try that app!,1
Absolutely!,1
Now... How many stars and planets could we add? To explore the universe would be very interesting. Tho imaging loosing your place and having to lock the system back in place and start again.Lot O processing.,1
"Now I get it, thank you so much for that, mate.",1
Does this bike trail have a name? I'd like to check it out.,1
I'd pay a couple of bucks for this app after trying a working beta. This is really cool.,1
can you make them orbit properly? I'd use it then for sure,1
"It’s a complicated thing to bring the colors out but, no, I do not add color that is not there.   This image is shot through filters onto a monochrome camera.   For example I use REd, green, and blue filters and the combination of those yield true color tones.   On top of that I layer the red of the hydrogen filter and the blue/green of the oxygen filter.    So the image is a combination of 5 channels of color data.... and handled appropriately to get the colors close to the “real” colors.   Of course the human eye can’t detect color on such faint objects, the the definition of “real” is even debatable.   Clear as mud, right?",1
Followed,1
This is crazy. I'm new to actually using a telescope but I'm just curious. Did you use a tracking tripod to counteract the stars movement. Sorry for not knowing the right terms. How much does it cost roughly to get into astrophotography since I would love to produce images like this some day,1
Love this! Especially if u can make a kids mode!,1
This is high level cool,1
Rings on Saturn?,1
"they are probably thinking scaled to size, not distance.",1
"Duuude, that's gonna be sweet!",1
Is this coded or is it an app?,1
send videos please!,1
"I'm in. And so will 50 other juniors of mine from college astronomy club.

When are you releasing it?",1
"Wow,i want that!!!!!!!",1
" Great potential as an educational app, too!",1
"Wow, good to know. Thanks for letting me know. If it looks too good to be true, that's usually the case.",1
I get lost in virtual reality “universe sandbox” all the time.,1
"This is my second attempt at M42. An im speechless. Im really happy how it turned out. 
This night was Pretty clear in my small town in Bavaria. I learned a lot of my previous mistakes and had a pretty good Polar alignment tonight.

Space is aptly named.,1
"Is this done in VR? Could you add labels to name the different planets? Maybe even light (white) overlay print providing distances, temperatures, etc. Maybe an option to display more info about what you are looking at, i.e. year discovered, distance to earth, relationship to other planets/stars, stars, atmosphere, etc.",1
"Awesome Demo!  Better get it out quick before someone knocks it off!

Feature request for:
V2: Add the asteroid belt.  
V3: Add active satellites abound planetary bodies (Earth might be a bitch though)
V4: add comets and asteroids and their paths with the ability to chase them around

This your captain speaking. That is all.",1
Hell yes! This is also grounds for an augmented reality RTS in space too lol,1
Please tell us when it will be available. And will it be for both iOS and android?,1
can we get this for the iPad please,1
I would! Is it going to be a phone app?,1
Or make it like a Star Trek HUD that shows all the information and you could touch certain points to pull up more information.,1
"If that was the actual scale, they would crash each other",1
"This is awesome, great work and an excellent way to interact with the planets.  Can you add rotations or movement to them, like moons orbiting their host planets, planets around the sun, etc?  Also I think others have mentioned scaling them but that might prove challenging.",1
Of course I would! :),1
It would be cool to scale these things to like the size of a city and make little asteroids and stuff at bars and then I can drink away the pain and throw my phone at a wall around virtual asteroid locales,1
Are you in Anchorage?,1
"Only if Master Yoda is there, and it’s in the Jedi temple.  
Serious note, that’s really awesome! Great job. I’d love to use this.",1
THIS IS SO COOL! Do you plan on having options to select “facts” about the planet?,1
Good to know!,1
Looks amazing to me. Definitely thinking of engaging the kids into it.,1
Dude elementary schools will be ALL OVER this. Such a cool interactive learning experience for kids,1
This would be so dope to have as an artist who paints a lot of space stuff!,1
I would love to see an app in which you can literally walk around the solar system and look at all of the planets asteroids etc as they are in real time.  Imagine the learning possibilities for physics students.  Also imagine one in which you can shrink down and actually learn about chemical reactions on a molecular level or biochemical reactions within a cell nucleus etc.,1
I would use the crap out of it! I’d be sad not to be able to use it in the dark since AR needs at least some light to see its space. But other than that it would be great!,1
None.,1
Just trying to get things to show up first.,1
"Y'all, scaling will be easy. I'll do it, lol",1
"That scope is horrendous and not even fully functioning. Go with a used celestron nexstar 8se for $800 instead and pick up a zwo planetary camera for $200. Any of the astro forums rip apart the evscope, they keep pushing back the release date for a reason... Its not working as advertised. Save your money.",1
Holy shit this on some VR goggles would be amazing for my daughter.,1
You could recreate that for under a grand if you're patient.,1
Barlow?,1
Those are absolutely not scaled,1
This is so fucking cool...,1
Do they just hover there or can you program them to orbit?,1
"Love it. If you could do the whole solar system and make it scalable, I would pay to own it.",1
I friggin love this.,1
"I got a question then, so do you add any artificial colours or is it only stacking pictures like you said, in other words could you explain the process.",1
Absofuckinglutely,1
Asking for labels. And more info for each object,1
Looks perfect for r/vrmegalophobia,1
Uh yes 100%,1

"Why would they have payed for NASA, not everyone's american.",1
This is fucking incredible,1
ARCore is so fun,1
This would be amazing!,1
"This looks awesome! If you want a beta tester, let me know!",1
Fuckin beautiful bud,1
Yes please!,1
This is cool AF. I'd love to play with that! Throw some other planets in there too.,1
Hell yea wow,1
"See this is the kind of stuff i wanted on my phones camera
Instead i got dinosaurs and some stupid emotes",1
Omg a fitness app would be so dope!!,1
"Yes I would, THIS IS AMAZING",1
I love it! I didn’t see the sun though. That would be great to see. I agree that the distance should be scaled as well. Great job!,1
My physics students would love this!,1
"This is great ! Also add in some features like asteroid belt, comets, Port cloud, well known nebulae and nearby stars and and galaxies - the planets are all in one plane, but these would be visible when you lift your head etc. Do add correct axial tilt and direction of rotation. Good job and good luck !",1
that's some bad ass functionality,1
"You should scale it properly but i’d love to use it, schools should use it to teach children. Please remind me when this app is released",1
"I agree, that would be so cool.",1
"Planets and distances are not scaled to each other in the video, but what you did was still amazing.  Scaled distance is not ‘realistically’ possible for the planet sizes you’re using.  The distances, even with small scaled planets, are insanely large.  For example if you use the Jupiter size you’re currently using, the sun would be on one side of a city and Pluto would be on the other.  I can imagine taking a trip through manhattan with friends, stopping at each planet, awesome field trip!  Much better to use two separate scales, though; one for size (so the planets are big enough to see), and one for distance (so you can fit them in a realistic space).  Doing both at one scale just doesn’t work well in spaces like football fields or smaller.  I’d be happy to help you with the scaling math, I do planets size and distance scaling with my middle school students every year.

And hells-to-the-yeah I would use an app like this!",1
420,1
Can you scale them?,1
Brilliant. I definitely would use this app. Would be cool if it was scaled in some way too!,1
Logarithmic,1
The bike trail I ride has a scale model of the solar system. It's about five miles from the sun to Pluto.  It really puts the size into perspective.,1
I would definitely pay for this. If they were orbiting and/or rotating at scale that would be icing on the cake,1
Yess 100% id download this...would be sick if you could zoom out and see the positions of stars/galaxies relative to each other but I understand thats exponentially more work haha good job 👍,1
"The idea/concept of it, to me is brilliant. Kids learning from this in the schoolyard, top teaching aid in my opinion. Well done.",1
Yes I would!,1
That was my first thought too. This would be mind blowing to see as a child and get to “explore” planets like this and could really help Title 1 schools as well as long as the app was cheap or free for teachers.,1
WOW,1
"*for those that don’t get what this has to do with astronomy*

This is the frequency the wow signal was transmitted on, which is also suspiciously close to the hydrogen line. It’s theorized that this is the frequency any technological civilization would transmit on to say hello.
 
thought it was fitting for a pair of listening devices 
haha

"Yes, definitely.",1
"Awesome job. I would definitely use something like this. Would be great if you could focus in on one planet and watch it orbit around the sun, or look at how the Earth goes from day/night by walking around it, etc.

Great idea, and could be a really useful and simple educational tool for people.",1
"I made an app that’s on every single phone. 

What you do is, important, go outside. Bring out your camera and turn it sideways (landscape mode). Take a picture of anything. Boom. Flat earth. 

You’re welcome sheeple.

I'll get it online asap. I hope he likes it!,1
I’D USE IT BUT IT WOULD BE COOL IF YOU COULD CHANGE THE SIZE OF EACH OBJECT,1
Now you’re talking my language,1
My 4 year old great nephew who wants to be an astronaut would be beside himself at getting to walk around the solar system!,1
Hell Yeah! 😁,1
I'd throw my money at you just to have this app!,1
"Wait till tomorrow, the update is gonna blow your mind.",1
This is dope,1
It would be really cool if you could see the whole solar system moving around the sun in their real orbits,1
Great work!,1
Is this exactly what your eyes saw when you used your telescope or you had to still develop the image to achieve this? I am thinking of buying a telescope but I want to be able to see this with my own eyes not have to develop an image.,1
"Honestly, I had no intention of putting it in the app store until i made this post.",1
Scale the distance lol,1
"As just an amateur astro enthusiast, I would absolutely use this! It would be really cool and educational.",1
"Just a thought, I might be wrong.....this looks like it could be a very lucrative app, should you be posting videos of it before you have released it officially?",1
You've seen enough but heres some more: THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!,1
What err scale are you using?,1
100% yes if everything is accurate and to scale....looks great,1
"I think they're properly scaled.
Anyway it's an amazing project!",1
"It would be so amazing to use this to actually learn about the scale of the Solar System, imagine. You start on the Earth and you have to walk an accurate distance to the other planets.",1
That's wicked,1
Word to ma nerds,1
I want this so much!,1
My wife teaches the solar system to her third graders and this was the first thing I thought of.,1
Quicker than biking [this model](https://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/dome-planetarium/community-solar-system),1
I would.  Nerdy Mawmaw...,1
Oh damn I can see this being better than Pokemon Go!,1
Good idea but I would make the scale a little bit more realistic. It would be also really cool if you could change how big the planets appear but the idea is really good.,1
"I love this!! Would totally use it, so cool!",1
I'll see what I can do.,1
Very cool man! Agree with the earlier comment - there should be a ‘scaled distance’ mode where you have to travel distances from the origin planet to see the moons. But very cool as-is!,1
That's awesome I wish there was something like this when I was in school.,1
Follow me to see more AR and space stuff.,1
Let us know when you release this. Will definitely download!,1
"I would totally use an app like this, especially if it included information about the planets, moons, and locations on each",1
Very good.,1
That is a good idea. I'm gonna do this,1
That really is fantastic. I look forward to seeing your posts in the new year!,1
That is really awesome. Good job!,1
Adding a scaled rotation rate for each planet would also be really cool!,1
That's fucking awesome!,1
"High praise thank you :)

Should be a higher res version somewhere here if you ever want to do anything with it.

https://www.stephenmack.space/blog/2019/01/26/january-26-2019-another-look-at-the-lunar-eclipse",1
Absolutely would use! Very cool!!,1
Yeah I'd give it the download,1
Very neat. Create it to scale and make the most horrifying app ever.,1
"I'd buy it if i could! Its amazing. 
It's also the first time I've realised the size of the earth's shadow!",1
Haha.  Yes !,1
"Thanks! That's actually the only one I've ever printed, it's on my cubicle wall :)

I know other people have done that same setup before but I love how it shows how large the shadow of the Earth is. Not sure who first came up with it but it's a really clever visualization, so hats off to whoever that person is!",1
"No ISS is basically as fast of a shutter speed as you can manage while still seeing it.

The iridium flare was about 30 seconds I think so it shows up as a streak. No telescope for that one.

The lower left has 2 geostationary satellites (the dots) and the streaks are background stars going by. That one was also 30 seconds exposures but an hours worth of them. Then in StarStax I combined them all so there star trails connected and showed up as streaks.",1
"Hell yeah, it would be really cool if you made it so you could enter the planets and get stats on the area of the planets(sun)",1
This is really cool. I didn’t really see the use for augmented reality but this is very useful and cool!,1
Goat's Eye,1
Which photos did you use long exposures/multiple layers for? I can’t imagine the ISS can be photographed that way right?,1
Sadly I don’t own a telescope but I’m happy people share what they find!,1
"Yes, I do this.   There are ways to do it in software and even weight them to preference the better frames.",1
Yes!! My kids would LOVE this!! I’d buy this app.,1
"If it puts them in the sky at scale as seen from say the distance of the moon, then I think you’d have something quite fun.",1
Cool AF,1
Absolutely brilliant.,1
This sounds awesome,1
I would absolutely use something like this!,1
Do you have to sort the bad frames from the good or have you used every exposure?  Couldn't one bad exposure ruin the good ones?,1
"Loving the top centre photo, well done",1
I’d make my students use it! That’s awesome!,1
Oh wow yes absolutely!!,1
Love it! Nice work,1
"Wow! Congratulations, there is something to look at :)",1
I plan on making the whole solar system huge but I won't be able to until tomorrow since it's dark outside and their won't be enough room in my house to show it.,1
This is too dope. I'm sure if you kept adding to it everyone would want it,1
This is absolutely amazing! Can you Zoom the Planets like make them Bigger or smaller? Does this work for Android? Just awesome!,1
I think it would be a great learning tool for students.,1
Only if they’re scaled accurately!  And it’ll double as a fitness app!,1
"There is literally nothing to see.  This object is so faint the image is essentially an even black.   The stacked image is in 32-bit space, so brightness variations are measured in parts per billion.    A key aspect of the processing (photoshopping, if you will, although I use different software) is to stretch this information out so that visual detail is revealed.",1
give this man a gold 🏆,1
Is it that bad without photoshopping it?,1
Lol.  It’s a black screen!   Editing is a necessary part of the process.,1
Have you got unphotoshopped version of it?,1
"Probably not, but well made!",1
This is really cool!,1
Time to build a satellite,1
"Thanks so much.   No. ...Chances are that nebula will keep expanding and slowly fade.   I think it’s about all I can squeeze out with an amateur rig.  The trick with the detail is not how long I can expose, but the stability of the atmosphere to not distort that fine detail.",1
[Sharpless catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpless_catalog),1
Check out the [HELIX NEBULA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Nebula),1
"So do you think it most likely that the other star will absorb most of that matter? Also, could you continue to photograph this specific nebula and expose even more detail, or is this about as good as it gets for you from our rock?

Wonderful shot btw.",1
TIL. Thanks!,1
I was thinking that too! And thank you,1
Nice representation. I wonder if it’ll be similar when Beetlejuice goes supernova.,1
"This one is a great start. I have nothing against motorized, just make sure you align properly or it's going to be a frustrating night. The kit eyepieces aren't going to be the greatest but not a bad start. You want different sizes for different objects. I would recommend a [power pack](https://www.celestron.com/products/powertank-12v-power-supply) because you'll want a really dark location to see something like M31 and generally you can't find an outlet in such places.

Photographing deep sky objects can get pricey. With some fiddling, you can use your cellphone but it won't be the best quality and you will see a lot of black around the edges from the eyepiece. It doesn't look like this Celestron has a camera mount but you can buy that separately. I haven't done any deep sky photography but talking to those that do, a camera with CCD sensor seems to be preferred to a DSLR, but you can still use a DSLR. You will want a telescope that tracks objects and this one will do nicely. OP has linked the gear they used somewhere on this thread and would be better at explaining deep sky photography.",1
You mean like....  Thanos Nebula?,1
"Thanks for the answer. I'm considering buying the celestron 130 slt. Does it include everything necessary in the package, so I can see som dsos? Like Orion nebulae and M31? Can I use my phone to capture som pictures or do I have to buy a dslr camera? Thanks for your encouragement.

I like it,1
"Somebody else's. For reals.  If you get a cheap one, you're not going to see what you're expecting and the interest wanes quickly. Then you have a cheap telescope taking up space in your closet. There are a few different types that range in price and operation pretty significantly. 

How do you use someone else's? Get involved in a local astronomers club and you'll see a variety that you can look at and knowledgeable people who can get you started. Also, start learning the sky without aids like telescopes otherwise you'll be flailing around in the dark. Star charts like [skymaps](http://www.skymaps.com/) work great for this. Just make sure you have the right one for your longitude and using it at the time it states.

Without getting into the jargon, I started with a motorized Celestron. But even with the tech, I personally found the telescope a pain to use. Mainly due to user error; I would align to the wrong star, which throws off the whole thing. A friend built me a 8"" dobsonain. Not motorized at all so I had to find things on my own. First thing I saw was Orion's Nebula and it was so freaking rewarding because I found it myself. The real money pit is the eyepieces and quality eyepieces is what gets you views like above*.

So yeah, don't jump in with a cheap telescope or dump tons of money into one you won't be able to work properly. This is a hobby/profession that takes a whole lot of patience, but the places it will take you and the things you learn along the way are simply interstellar.

*Eyepieces are important to see clearly but the amount of light captured by the telescope plays a large roll as well. Again not trying to get too bogged down in the details.

Edit: add the asterisk and spelling",1
"No secret really, just attention to collimation and the tracking necessary at the long focal length.   Its hard to relate just how small this target is, so those details definitely matter.",1
Whats the secret to such sharp images on a SCT?,1

There are no telescopes in earth orbit or on earth’s surface that can actually image to that high resolution - you could theoretically achieve that resolution with a much larger telescope or with a telescope array!,1

"r/astrophotography has a Weekly Ask Anything thread and they are helpful.

Now, to answer your question. Yes, a good mount is important. And a guide scope to improve tracking. But, to get those long times, people are taking multiple exposures and then stacking them. 

So if you can shoot for 10 minutes with no trails, then you would take 180 10-minute shots over multiple nights to get to 30 hours. Then those shots are stacked together.",1
Thanks! It means a lot to see reactions like this :),1
Thank you so much for this! I will use this as a guide,1
"EVERYTHING depends on the mount. 
A bad mount will make the best telescope useless. A good mount can make a crappy telescope usable.

Ive pushed my Celestron 5i at F10 up to 90sec without star trails. Those mounts are not exactly known for their highly accurate tracking for AP use. I was able to get 180sec out of it but there were too many bad frames to waste the time with that exposure length. 

I added a heavy duty wedge to it and spent about an hour getting an alignment on Polaris (mostly it was fussing with the mount to get it aligned before fine tuning it). It was not POLAR aligned because I was happy enough with the results from polaris. I could MAYBE push 2min subs with it actually on the NCP but I will not get 5+ min out of it.",1
"The most important piece of equipment for AP is not a telescope, it's the mount. You need a good quality Equatorial mount. They start around $1000 for entry-level mounts like the Skywatcher HEQ5 or Celestron AVX and go up from there. Don't bother with the sub-$800 mounts, they're suitable for visual astronomy but not so much for AP. The more mount you can afford, the better time you'll have with AP. I would actually recommend starting with something mid-range like an Orion Atlas or Celestron CGX if you can afford it.

As long as your mount is good, the rest of the rig can be relatively entry-level price stuff. You can get decent budget apochromatic refractors for just a few hundred bucks and small guidescopes for even under a hundred. Imo any decent DSLR camera will do. 

I recommend watching the *Astrobackyard* YouTube channel and learning as much as you can from there before starting to spend money on an AP rig.",1
So it really depends on the mount does it?,1

"Sh2-71 - A Complex Planetary Nebula

This is an example of what happens when a sun-sized star runs out of nuclear fuel.

I shot images for about 27 hours total to complete this image.    My telescope rides on a tracking mount to counteract the Earth’s spin.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If you’d like to read on, here’s a little description of what you are seeing...

As a sun-like star begins to deplete it’s hydrogen fuel, a sequence of interesting change is initiated. The core, unable to support its own crushing gravity, compresses and increases dramatically in temperature. In an opposite fashion, outer atmosphere swells and cools under the intense pressure from within. A red giant is born.

Though there are several possible outcomes, many stars begin to gradually shed the outer atmosphere to deep space. This is the beginning of a planetary nebula.

As the core continues its collapse it emits extreme ultraviolet radiation. The radiation ionizes the gasses of the nebula giving rise to a wonderfully colorful and intricate design.

In this case, the stellar parent is a binary star system. This pair, one dying, sculpts a unique and beautifully complex nebula. Romantic or cannibalistic?

Enjoy!   Let me know what you think.  If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them.

"Thanks, and it's really not that hard at all from our own backyard.",1
"Yes, I was surprised when I first captured it to see how fast it rotated.",1
"Depends on what you want to image and how good you want the image quality to be. 

I’ll tell you right now that it can get expensive very quickly, so please do research before you purchase equipment and what not. 

You will need a German equatorial mount. Period. You’ll get field rotation with an alt-az mount so they aren’t great for photography. There are a lot of good options when it comes to GEMs. Just make sure that it is enough to handle the load of the telescope, camera, guide scope, etc. 

Pretty much all experienced astrophotographers would recommend a small refractor as your starter. This is because the small focal length has a large FOV and it makes things such as small guiding errors more forgiving than say a SCT. These are much better for nebulae and galaxies, where as the SCT shines with planetary imaging. The catch here is that you want the quality of the glass to be very good, so expect to pay for it. Again, a lot of great options there, I’ll let others recommend brands. 

As far as the camera goes, a lot of people are switching to the CCDs and rightfully so. Stock DSLR cameras get the job done but without filters they aren’t the best for AP, but you can get them modded specifically for it. The more expensive CCDs have cooling features which really helps with noise reduction. 

There are narrowband and broadband filters you can attach to the camera to take different sets of data that you can combine later in processing software. You can combine these to get great detail. Shooting with the HA filter in the city is a miracle. 

If you want exposures longer than say 2 minutes you’ll need a guide scope. You’ll need to get a separate camera to act as your auto guider. There are a bunch of options, a popular one being the ZWO brand.",1
"We would also appreciate information about the price, how, and where to get it.",1
"Very early on, 17th century I think, astronomers used Io's orbit to calculate the speed of light. They measure it's orbital period, then compare that to the time the moon is hidden from view, the depending of is earth is catching up or moving away from Jupiter the orbital period changes. Some math and presto you get a surprisingly accurate speed of light. 

All this came about because someone was so obsessed with this motion that they meticulously recorded it for years.",1
Mt Teide observatory in Tenerife might be worth checking out.,1
"since you can't use the internet for information i won't use it as well:

the angular resolution of your telescope is given by:

α = 1.22 \* λ/D

λ ... wavelength you observe with, visible light goes from around 400 nm to around 700 nm, i am going to use 500 nm for the estimation 

D ... diameter of your telescopes, i am not sure which one you have exactly, i am using 76 mm for this estimation

α = 8.026e-6 rad = 1.66"" 

rad to "" is \*180/π\*3600

so that's the smallest angle you can see with your telescope 

now to the angular size of the ISS:

pretty hard without internet to estimate tbh. Two things we need, how high up is it. I know it's around 400 km, since i havecalculated something related to the ISS in every astrophysics course, so i am using this

i don't know how wide it is, i am guessing it's around 100 metres 

for the angular size we have:

tan β/2 = w/2 /d 

w ... width of the object, so 100 metres 

d ... distance to the observer, i am using 400 km

-&gt; β = 0.0143° = 51.7""

so your resolution is 1.66"" while the ISS should be around 50"", should be easily doable 

i don't know if i used too much info, can't do it with less

if you do this what also would be interesting, how the results compare to a different method i was thinking of

for that one you have to know how long the ISS is and also the size of an reference object something like the moon

to sketch my thoughts:

you know (if you google it) the diameter of the moon, you also know the distance, therefore you know the angular size a""

then you count x pixels of the moons diameter, you know then a"" equals x pixels

then you count y pixels of the ISS (i don't know what school and grade you are, but you could get crazy with sub-pixel accuracy if you want to) 

you know a"" equals x pixels, with the y pixels that gives you the angular size of the b"" of the ISS

when you know the (googled) with of the ISS you can calculate the distance to you

then you need to know the angle at which the picture was shot and that gives you distance above the ground - looking at the top comment

i don't really understand why you are not allowed to look up some facts you don't know",1
"So there's 4 more to see for you. I'd try looking at the sky at dawn or sunrise because at that time they appear as the 'last stars remaining' or 'first stars occuring', so they are easier to detect as they can't be misinterpreted as real stars.",1

With patience and practice you may even spot the Red Spot (though most amateur scopes don't have the light gathering ability to see the red in it. You'll be able to easily see the rings of Saturn too. And when Mars comes around closest to earth next year, you'll be able to see the polar cap and maybe some surface detail.

For this picture data was collected in black and white through 3 different filters (H-alpha, O3 and S2), then combined into a color (LRGB) using the math described to blend the data into the 3 different color channels.  The filters used do not really correspond directly to a specific color, but a very specific wavelength of light, thus the need to assign them to a color.  Usually there are 4 filters used, one is referred to as a luminance filter which just filters out UV and IR, but the OP stated they used the H-alpha filter for the luminance.",1

So amazing!!! I imagine what size is in real.,1
"I can mount my phone to the lens and take a video.
Will that be good enough to capture it?",1
"In the video they take pictures of the transit from two locations to get the distance to the ISS, that will be difficult with the Firstcopes because they don't have any motor drive. So to keep the Moon in view you have to be looking through the telescope, and then you don't have a camera. The transit is so quick I doubt if you could measure the angle without taking a picture.

You could piggyback a camera with a telephoto lens on the firstcope but it will take practice to track the Moon with that setup.",1
"If you can't get *out* of the city get as *high* as you can, above as much of the pollution and light as possible. Griffith Observatory is the obvious place to go (and they have public viewing nights AFAIK).",1

I’d start with planet viewing just so you’re more familiar with your telescope. Then start looking for M42 and M45.

Yeah there are better equipped telescopes for viewing nebulae but if you’re like me, I don’t need 100% perfect, NASA-released quality picture... I just want to be able to locate it and see it, even if it’s a fuzzy picture lol. And I can’t afford a new 1,500+ telescope 🤷🏻‍♀️",1

There are some areas I want to try not too far from here that are very remote and should have minimal light pollution.  Unfortunately my house has quite a few trees and houses, so items at the horizon line are hard from here.  But I was to try and find spots where I can see some of the objects at the lower altitudes.",1
"New eyepieces should definitely help you; if the one you got left is a 1.25” Barlow, then you should be able to get anything else to go with it. If it’s not, make sure to grab a couple of barlows.

(I also bought a sh*tty Celestron kit of lenses so I’d have an idea of which sizes I wanted to drop real money on)

Just give the site your location and they'll predict them for any remaining satellites.

Gonna be hard if ya can't use the internet as you need to look up when these lunar transits will occur in your area. They don't happen very often over any given location and you may need to travel a short distance to see it. The path of visibility is very narrow. Only a few miles wide or so.,1
"Considering that the closest star to us is very far, a star dying and exploding would be a spectacular and lengthy view. Nothing regarding a star happens in such a short amount of time. It may have been something reflecting or burning up.",1
Well regardless of the process - it's a fantastic result. Beautifully done and magnificent photo,1
"Most likely an Iridium satellite. These are famous for suddenly brightening then fading from visibility. It's caused by sunlight reflecting off their almost mirror like antemnas. If a star had exploded, we would see it for weeks or months before fading from view.",1
What causes that lens flare to the left of the nebula? Every picture I’ve seen of it has that same flare. Is it an especially bright or close star?,1

very funny that the sky is clear but the sun has a little cloud.",1

"The general response to that is no, that's not how our eyes would see it. But astrophotography is all about making things visible that the eye can't see, so it kinda is the point, isn't it?

This is quite accurate though. Its a rgb image, so it is taken with red green and blue color filters, that's how it eyes see things too. Its not like the blue + orange false color palette that Hubble uses, this is pretty close to real color.

 It has infrared though. The infrared part can't be shown in true color because obviously, we wouldn't be able to see it then. The infrared part is added as ""normal"" visible red.

Tl;dr: it's not real color, but also not false color. it's relatively close to real.",1
That's truly excellent work...my good Chum.,1
FINALLY! your images are stunning and I've wanted one as wallpaper for so long and this one is absolutely perfect. Is there anywhere to donate to you for these phenomenal works?,1

"I don't understand any of what you said. In plain English, is the color real?",1
"The instruments housed in the chambers with the small windows were likely designed to only take readings when objects were on the meridian. Thus, they only need the window facing south (and maybe also north depending on how the instrument is designed). Take a look at the Mural Quadrant on page 24 of the link I provided previously. It is affixed to a wall and sighted through the window. It is likely that the other windows are meant to provide more airflow so it doesn't get so stuffy.

In the ones with more windows, it is noted that these are revolving quadrants, hence why there is more visibility. However, some of the sky would still be blocked at any given time.",1
"First, go to r/astrophotography. It's a fun subreddit with helpful people. Read the sticky and there is a Weekly Ask Anything Thread. Very helpful. I'm still learning and find it inspiring and useful. 

Next, you can get started with wide field astrophotography using a DSLR, used Canon and Nikon are favorites but any camera where you can set the shutter time in seconds will do, and a barn-door tracker. This will get you nebulas and clusters and other extended objects. 

The barn door tracker offsets the earths rotation so that you can track objects for long exposures with no streaking. You can build a manual one from scraps and commonly found parts. For far less than $100 USD, you can motorized it.

To actually take photos, you typically take a lot of shots for as long as you can without streaking. Then on a computer stack them together, and the tweak them to pull out details and add color.

This is a nice walk through https://astrobackyard.com/deep-sky-astrophotography-walkthrough/. Note that he's using a lot of *expensive* equipment. You don't need it (but it helps). Just read it to get a feel for the steps--the process. There are also tutorials on-line for processing. If you can't afford Photo shop, you can also use The Gimp and there are tutorials for it, too.",1
"Wow thanks for the reply! I see I must have been mistaken about the observatories facing north.  

So, in the only contemporary illustrations I find of Stjerneborg, at least 3 of the 5 sunken instrument chambers (have domed rooves)[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Tycho_Brahe%27s_Stjerneborg.jpg] and only some small windows.

This comment made me actually lol,1
"There's a lot to unpack here as these are all different instruments. 

Ulugh Beg's primary instrument, the Fakhrī sextant, is essentially a gigantic piece of a protractor. Based on its configuration, my assumption is that this was really only good for solar (and perhaps lunar) observations as they cast as shadow. In [this image](https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzFlMjY2NTY0YTc5ZTM0M2UzOWM4ZWFlY2VlZTBjOWRjNjViZWNkN2QuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMjAweD4iXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il1d/1e266564a79e343e39c8eaeceee0c9dc65becd7d.jpg), you can get an idea of how it would have worked: The window at the far end faces south and the sun will stream in through that window. If a bar were placed across that window, it would cast a shadow on the scale and when the sun is lined up perfectly south along the meridian, the width of the window would fall perfectly on the width of the scale indicating precisely when it was solar noon.

Since the sun changes altitude throughout the year, this would change. The length of time between the extremes of those changes is the length of the year. However, that's not an integer value, so the average of many years would have to be taken to get down to the ultimate precision cited. The angle between the mean and the extremes is the obliquity of the ecliptic. 

The same is true of Gaocheng; it is a solar observatory. However instead of a curved arc, it appears to use a straight one which will obviously lead to distortions in the spacing between units so it must have taken this into account. Both of these instruments get their power by simply being extremely more massive allowing for greater precisions.

Stjerneborg is a different story as it housed a large number of instruments. Only a few of them were sunk into the ground, such as the one seen on [page 28 in this translation of his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica](http://jonvoisey.net/Astronomiae_Instauratae_Mechanica.pdf). This instrument is absolutely for stars and planets and is used by sighting along the alidade AK. However, you'll notice that if you look along it you're always pointing up, out of the hole or structure in which it resides, so you will always have an unobstructed view. Only when you get very close to the horizon does it become a problem but given the amount of atmospheric distortion which Tycho was well aware of, observing near the horizon is not productive anyway. However, this instrument is able to rotate both in altitude and azimuth. The radius of the quadrant is about 5.5 ft, and with precision engraving on the scale, Tycho's instruments were able to be accurate to a few seconds of arc.",1
"Thanks for your reply, well I understand of where you are coming from. As you do at the beginning  I have suspected ground related phenomenon but I had dismissed it due the fact that all clouds had moved except for this one? In addition that spot is relatively with less light pollution. Then after couple of hours I started considering other explanations, a cosmic ones.
However according to my assumption if it is an interplanetary dust particles within the orbit of Moon for instance and some of which being illuminated by Sun I think it would describe what I saw. 
Tonight I will do another round of observation to confirm or do dismiss. And I hope that other people have yesterday, and/or will do tonight.


https://i.imgur.com/5RsmtU6.jpg",1
"Yes, that's it.",1
"Well maybe I haven’t described it right as English isn’t my first language apparently, but earth since the winter solicit is still on L2 spot relatively to Sun. In addition to the fact that we had a solar eclipse couple of days ago, I suspect that we had a special illumination of interplanetary particles within the solar system or from earth cosmic yard. I will observe tonight again to confirm or to draw different conclusions. Thus why I asked for confirmations from different spots around the globe it wasn’t a local phenomena and it has something to do with dust, or interplanetary objects.

"A couple months ago I had the plan to image the famous horsehead, however a single panel failed to include a lot of the interesting surrounding nebulosity and so I upped it to a 3 panel. 
On top of that I decided to make it an HaLRGB image, I estimated roughly 11 hours per panel, 5 to Ha, 3 to L and 3 to RGB. In actuality it equated to 32.5 hours total!
This has been my most ambitious project yet, I spent over a month just acquiring the sufficient data, several days spent processing (9k x 4k images are slow on my computer)

All at 21 offset, -15  degrees celsius.
LRGB at gain 76, Ha at unity (139).

* Acquired with the NINA imaging suite. Guided with PHD2. Mount interface: EQMOD

**Processing:** 

Created 12 stacks, HaLRGB per panel. (3 panels)
The RGB for each panel was ABE'd, then linear fitted then RGB combined, resulting in 3 RGB images representing each panel.
Each L panel had DBE applied, TGV and MMT for NR. 
Each Ha panel had the same as L but additionally Deconvolution.

3 Mosaics were then created from all these panels as such:
Platesolved central panel, created a Catalog Star image the size of the mosaic (10kx4k)
Star aligned each panel to this catalog star image.
DNALinearfitted the 3 panels.
GMM to combine.

As a result an Ha, L and RGB mosaic were generated.

Then L and R (in the RGB) were enhanced with the Ha via the pixel math detailed in the LVA tutorial.
The RGB was then stretched slightly with arcinsh and then HT.
The L was stretched with just HT.

Then had to perform a fix on the stars in the central panel red channel of the RGB mosaic. This stack used out of focus red data, and I for some reason let it progress this far down the line without noticing (I guess this is what you get for processing at 3am). 
This fixed involved making a starmask using starnet and then clonestamping out in focus stars. Applying mask to the red channel and using deconvolution motion blur.


Star reduction on both the RGB and L.
LRGB Combination with chrominance NR.
Several rounds of curves and LHE with masks targetting different brightness regions of the image.
Masked out the flame nebula to shift the red hues away that come from the Ha. This achieves the normal RGB look which is more appealing for the flame.
HDRMT on small reflection nebula (really minor)
Brought image into PS for Selective colour, toyed with the sliders to push the pinky reds into a deeper red colour.
Back into PI, using starnet, desaturated the reds in the stars (rather intense red stars from arcinsh).

Bit of clone stamping out some artefacts from GMM and blue spike from alnitak that extended the whole image.

**Other notes:**

Definitely a few hiccups can be noticed at 1:1 scale, primarily red channel on the central panel was out of focus and so the stars were quite bad, still residual issues.
The noise profile differs between the panels and so an edge can be spotted.
HFR/FWHM on the right panel is much greater due to lower guiding quality. (possibly nights with bad seeing)

Please give me constructive criticism! I want to improve this craft further.",1

"I don’t know where you got that box from, but literally none of the Star Adventurer boxes have telescopes on them - it’s all DSLRs and lenses. Even on the Skywatcher website do they not mention or show telescopes - only lenses. So I don’t see the point in lying to try and prove your point.

If your camera weighs less than literally a glass of water, then I’d assume it’s not too good for AP. People generally use DSLRs or cooled CCDs, all of which definitely do not weigh 1/4 pound. Most of them weigh at least 1lb or more.

People struggle with the Star Adventurer @300mm unguided. Now imagine 2x that - all the errors will be more apparent and every breeze will be more visible. You WILL need a guiding setup for anything over 400mm, and 650mm is quite over that. Add a guide scope and guide camera, and you’ll already be way over the limit even without a camera. And it’ll be difficult to actually balance your scope with 1kg of counterweights, and with such a tiny dovetail. Plus there’s no dovetail saddle on the declination axis, so you’ll be forced to thread 650mm of scopes onto that tiny L-bracket, so you’re bound for a ton of flexture. Speaking about declination, the Star Adventurer doesn’t guide in that axis so good luck if you have any errors in polar alignment or wind, which will most definitely be apparent at 650mm.

Plus unless you have a special photographic reflector, you’ll face issues with back focus. It probably only has a 1.25” focuser as well, so you’ll need to upgrade the focuser to remove vignetting and to fit the most important accessory - a coma corrector. It’s possible to do AP without it, but only the centre of the picture will look nice. Point is, you’ll be much happier with using your camera and a lens than a reflector and camera with your Star Adventurer.",1

"This is actually a pretty fun comparison.

The energy released as light and heat by leaving tin foil in a microwave depends on how you long you leave it in, but something like 1000 Joules is a pretty reasonable upper limit.

The bomb dropped on Hiroshima released 63 trillion Joules. Call it 100 billion = 10^11 times more powerful than tin foil in a microwave.

Betelgeuse will release about 10^44 Joules in visible forms (most of the energy goes to neutrinos; we won't count them). That's about 10^30 Hiroshima bombs. A thousand billion billion billion times more powerful.

Your comparison is very unfair to the tin foil. We need an energy release of more like 10^-16 Joules. A sound wave with this amount of energy is below the limit of human hearing.

Betelgeuse is to the Hiroshima bomb what a Hiroshima bomb is to the sound of mosquito wing-beats divided by one hundred.",1

"Yes, the star is opaque to light but not neutrinos. Neutrinos are emitted at the moment of core collapse, but the light can't escape until later in the explosion.",1
"Yes, that’s definitely a limitation.  Without a tracking mount, you’re really limited to wide field (low magnification) shots with very short exposures.   As long as you can mount your camera to the eyepiece with a stable mount and activate your camera without touching it, you should be able to get some cool shots.  It’s all about stability.  With some phones you can activate the shutter with the volume button on the earbud cables, which is ideal because you don’t disturb your mount that way.  You can also use a 10s timer, which will allow the telescope to re-stabilize after you’ve touched the shutter button on your phone camera.  Keep experimenting and reading and your skill will improve quickly.   Don’t get discouraged - this hobby can be frustrating at any skill level, but it’s so rewarding when you capture a great shot, and sitting outside on a dark night, watching the sky, is one of life’s simplest pleasures!  I joke that astrophotography is the hobby that keeps on taking:  taking money, time, patience.....

Good luck!",1
Amazing progress!,1

Also, since I am still in reading/research mode, I'll share this. Expect to spend lots of time reading and sorting through some technical material and evaluating and learning software at first.

"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sharing with you the progress I've made in this new hobby for me. I bought my first telescope on February this year and when I first saw Jupiter and its moons on the eyepiece I couldn't resist snapping a picture with my phone. It came out like a fuzzy white smudge and I was still excited to be able to take a picture of a planet so far away from us right from my rooftop. I instantly got hook with planetary imaging and started to look up how to take better pictures of them with the equipment I had.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the pictures were taking using my Celestron Nexstar 6SE with a 2x Barlow. At first, my main gear for photography was my iphone 6 and sometimes I would borrow a Canon 70D DSLR from a  friend. So I had limited time with it and couldn't really get the hang of it for planetary, you can see this as my iphone pictures were turning out with a similar quality and by July I could say I was getting better results with my phone than a $2.000 camera. But then I got my dedicated camera for planetary imaging and I was amazed of the jump in quality. I can't wait to use it on opposition and to take my first images of Mars and Venus.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the full-res [image](https://i.imgur.com/8IIlNpA.png) and feel free to ask any questions or tips on how to improve your imaging and processing.",1

"A few comments:
1.  48 MP is way more resolution than you need because your optics actually limit the effective resolution.  If you can shoot at a lower resolution, post processing and storage will be much easier.  

2.  I noticed your stars are streaked (not pinpoint).  This indicates movement during exposure.  1s is a very short exposure, so I wouldn’t expect to see this.  I’m guessing you’re shooting through an eyepiece; you may want to consider a longer focal length eyepiece to reduce the magnification and widen the field of view.  This will both brighten your image and reduce streaking if the stars.  A properly aligned motor-driven tracking mount is your best bet, though.  Of course, that costs money!  Also, if you don’t already have it, invest in a good camera mount so you can take photos without vibrations or movement.",1
"I am not 100% sure. Download the Heavens Above app to see if you can get more information. If not, I am sure you can get the answer to your question  with a little Google searching. 

Also, just so you know, generally speaking, the best time to see satellites is just after the Sun goes down, or just before the Sun comes up. What happens is, although it is completely dark at your location, the satellite is still in Sun light.",1
"A RAMBLE ON GR AND GRAVITY

Hmm some dubious answers in the comments. Newtonian gravity says its a force, and Einstein's general relativity says it is a curving of spacetime, and changes that lead to gravitional waves propogate at the speed of light. If the sun vanished, it would take 8 minutes before earth would start heading off in a ""straight line"".

We know its CAUSED by mass. We dont exactly know WHY it curves spacetime.

Curved spacetime is quite easy to visualize why a body orbits another body. It thinks its going in a straight line, the straight line is curved!

However, it is not fully know what causes a body to START moving towards another body. So, throwing a tennis ball away from me, sure it follows a curved path until it hits the ground. If I drop it from my hand, why is it compelled to move into a more elongated area of spacetime?

We simply dont know a lot of that stuff yet. BUT from what I understand from General Relativity,  time is passing more slowly nearer a massive object, and for some reason, an otherwise-stationary (in its own frame of reference) object (like a tennis ball I let go of) wants to get down into that slower time. 

Who doesnt like to take things slower?",1
"Thanks a lot, that's exactly what I was looking for!

"Welcome to the wonderful world of astrophotography!  Once you’ve been bitten it’s hard to stop!  There are many resources for image processing techniques, as well as a few helpful forums (Cloudynights.com, for example).  You’ll find numerous resources and folks are generally very happy to help.  

Your image is a great example to learn from.  Unfortunately, your ability to effectively edit it is highly dependent on your budget.   Can you tell us a little about the equipment you used?

The first thing you notice is the “vignette” effect, where the image is much brighter in the center.  This is due to effects from the optical tube and can be tricky to fix.  Some software packages can deal with it to some extent, but the most effective method is to take “flat frames” and use a program called “Deep Sky Stacker” to normalize the brightness across the image.  You’ll need to do some reading to figure this out because it’s really beyond the scope of a comment on Reddit.  Some programs that allow you to add the vignette effect also allow you to “subtract” it, such as Lightroom (free app on iPhone), but the effectiveness is limited.  

As far as brightness and contrast go, there are many free options to explore and they can help you get the most out of your image.   For my money, I would purchase a program called Startools.  It’s inexpensive and can deal with vignetting, noise, and color correction.

I’m convinced that no one in this thread has actually read the article,1
"Imagine you managed to construct this thing. It's perfectly spherical, perfectly centered around its star, and made out of some unknown material that can withstand the stresses.

Now it gets a little bump from some passing space debris. It's not centered anymore. One side feels slightly more gravity than the other, so it starts to bend inwards, which exacerbates the problem, causing that side to feel even more gravity. This is now a runaway process. The instability will grow until you hit the breaking point of the material you built this thing out of, and the whole structure collapses.

In addition to the physics of it, which is essentially impossible to make work, u/AbstinenceWorks made a great point about the economics. A swarm is _easier_. You seem to think a Type II civilization would somehow ignore the economics. That is not particularly likely. If you can accomplish everything with swam that you could with a sphere, why would any civilization, no matter how powerful, waste massive amounts of effort to try to get a sphere to work? Sure, maybe they believe spheres are holy and have some near-magical sci-fi tech to build them with, but that does not strike me as likely. What is far more likely is a swarm.",1

This is incredible! If you had told me this is a Hubble pic I would’ve believed it,1
"Firstly for AP, you would ideally want half of the recommended payload. Add a camera and you’ll already be over the limit of 11 lbs (in reality should be 6-7). And the Star Adventurer was designed for short focal lengths, no more than 200-300mm. A 5” scope will probably be 650mm. The gears aren’t accurate enough for tracking at long exposures of that focal length, not to mention how tiny the mount actually is and how big the scope is, so it would be really wobbly and unstable. There’s a reason why people recommend at least a Sirius or HEQ5 for AP.",1

"Well you have to account for the universe’s expansion, and the duration it takes to travel which is ~640 light years away.

"I have a  Skywatcher 200P 8 inch dob which is fantastic. AD8, XT8 are also good ones.",1
Yh I was thinking this. Was just wondering what brands etc people recommend/ build quality is nice,1
"So, the best scope in terms of visuals is going to be the one with the biggest aperture. If you want to find every object manually every time (and I really enjoy this aspect of the hobby), then a Dobsonian will give you by far the best bang for buck. If you're good at making stuff, then you can build your own!

If you want a computer to find objects for you, then you'll be looking at a 'Goto mount'. These cost a lot more than a typical Dobsonian scope!

My 'Goto Mount' is my brain + a copy of Stellarium  ;)
https://stellarium.org/

When buying a large telescope, really take the weight into account. If you can't face dragging the scope into the garden because it's cumbersome heavy, then it'll be a waste of money. You're not going to get anything that heavy for under $300 though. A 6"" is probably the best deal. Something like this: https://optcorp.com/products/orion-skyquest-xt6-classic-dobsonian-telescope-kit

Also bear in mind that you could easily many times that initial $300 on accessories. I have well over £1000 in accessories, while my scope cost me £200. Luckily I feel I have everything I need, although a new focuser wouldn't go amiss...

The kit I linked to will be enough to get you started, but if you get into it, you'll be browsing for lots of extra stuff almost immediately  :)",1

"Easier, sure, but we're talking about the kind of civilization that *could*. Hell, aside from logistics, we're almost able to start work on a Dyson swarm - but we are in no way a type-II civilization. We're not even a type-I.",1

Yes.We are moving...think of our sun moving in a straight line and planets also moving while revolving around the sun,1
"**Cosmological horizon**

A cosmological horizon is a measure of the distance from which one could possibly retrieve information. This observable constraint is due to various properties of general relativity, the expanding universe, and the physics of Big Bang cosmology. Cosmological horizons set the size and scale of the observable universe. This article explains a number of these horizons.

Yes the sun made me do this.,1
Gravity doesn't travel at the speed of light because it doesn't travel. Gravitational waves are what travel at the speed of light. These are generated by a specific *change* in a gravitational field.

"The nearest supernova progenitor candidate is, strictly speaking, IK Pegasi at 154 light years. This system is a main sequence star orbiting a white dwarf. When the main star expands into a red giant, the white dwarf will accrete material until it explodes as a Type Ia supernova. This will take a Long Time even by astronomical standards.

The nearest type II supernova candidate (Betelgeuse-style) is either Spica or Bellatrix, both around 250 light years. Bellatrix is right on the border of being massive enough to supernova. If it does, it will explode in about 5 million years or so. Spica is definitely massive enough, and will explode in around 20 million years.

"I do wonder if you could be a 'true' Dyson sphere much the same way you build a stone arch: carefully &amp; symmetrically.

Say you build a 'Dyson ring' that orbited the sun around its equator, probably completed by starting at 'seed points' in orbit that were built wider along the orbit. Then, you make it 'taller' by extending this ring to the north and south in equal steps. The whole thing would probably require constant energy input to keep it balanced (thank goodness there is plenty locally available) until the poles of the sphere were 'capped' and it could become mechanically stable.

I know there are other considerations when it comes to orbital structures, but I do wonder if they could be overcome with clever mechanical design and construction techniques, and actively controlling the whole structure.",1

You only have to worry about the ones that are massive enough to go supernova.,1
But the article is literally from today... and it says it’s the dimmest they’ve ever recorded it being...?,1
I am not a scientist but I believe gravity propagates at exactly the speed of light.,1
"In all likelihood, this is exactly what it implies... although the article states that this is the dimmest it’s *ever* been like technically recorded to be, with the second dimmest period occurring in the 1920s. 

One guy near the end mentions he expects it to begin brightening again relatively soon, but if the dimming continues for several more weeks, then “all bets are off” - whatever that means. I take it to mean that if it continues to dim, we simply do not have a theoretically model to explain the behaviour other than imminent supernova.",1
To be fair anyone that could do it would think we're lame for thinking THAT was cool compared to any number of unimaginable technological miracles they'd done. We have no clue what the possibilities are,1
"Ah, I see your a man of culture as well.",1
"The article mentions that the star is a short lived variety and is, relatively speaking, nearing the end of its life. The estimate is it’s got a million years left, max, with some kind of feeling it’ll happen within a hundred thousand years. We obviously do not have the tools to really adequately predict a supernova. 

It is known to periodically dim, and its believed there is a longer cycle that is like hundreds of years, and a shorter cycle of hundreds of days, that each contribute to its variations in observed brightness. The theory is that the two cycles are currently overlapping, leading to its excessive and rapid dimming. Having said that, this is the dimmest it’s ever been recorded to be, with the second dimmest having been in the 1920s. 

All that being said, I’m no mathematician but I’d say the chances are quite slim. 

But, if you’d like to keep up hope, one scientist said that if the star continues to dim for a few more weeks, “all bets are off”. I assume that means we don’t have a model to explain that behaviour other than imminent supernova.",1

The Earth has recently (4 July, 1054) had a similarly bright [relatively nearby supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Pulsar) and it was only a passing curiosity. Betelgeuse is around 10 times closer to Earth than SN 1054 was, so will probably be ~100 times brighter, but that's still not enough to cause real problems. A supernova needs to be within ~100 light years to start being concerning, and more like &lt;30 light years before we start making continuity of civilization plans.

Given that the Milky Way has around 1 supernova per 100 years, the Solar System has lived through around 40 million or so supernovae in the Milky Way since the emergence of life. Of these, a few hundred ish were closer to Earth than Betelgeuse, a handful may even have been inside the *yikes* range where it got a little extra toasty on Earth for a bit, but none caused any detectable problems.",1

Still, most likely not aliens. More likely the star is dying or going through some kind of phase. My guess is it's related to the bulge.",1

What's the story,1
What are the actual chances of seeing this during our lifetime?,1
"No.

Betelgeuse has multiple variable periods where it brightens and darkens and these periods overlap. Right now we have its two primary variable periods overlapping in a darkening phase. Sort of like how when solar tides and lunar tides overlap you have [spring tides,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Range_variation:_springs_and_neaps) or the dark spots in the double slit experiment.

We expect Betelgeuse to go supernova sometime in the next 100,000 years. There's nothing to suggest this is anything unusual.

Good for clicks though.",1
I've been hoping this event would take place during my lifetime since I was knee high. The temptation to go purchase a telescope so I can get some good pictures is going to be hard to resist.,1
Dont look back in anger,1
It would be cool to be able to know at what stage Betelgeuse currently is with astronomical observations...by stage I mean the fusing of available fuel into sequentially heavier elements...once it reaches iron and it takes more energy to compress than is produced...death is inevitable and quick...24 hours and it goes nova,1
I wonder if astronomers will ever come up with terminology to discuss astronomical events which we see in the present which actually occurred long ago due to their extreme distance...,1
"I think you are correct in your assumption but there has already 
been one correction in our knowledge about this star. Until recently 
it was believed to be only 430 light years away. The variation in 
brightness that the star cycles through would likely make any 
measurement of its size and age have a greater uncertainty.",1
In all honesty though we don’t know for sure how accurate we would or wouldn’t be with the predictions. This hasn’t happened in 400 years and there’s no telling that if the last one happened today we could’ve predicted it all that closely to know it was going to happen really soon.,1

"&gt;\[Astronomer\] suspects that Betelgeuse is dramatically dimmer now because two of its cycles are overlapping at minimal brightness

"Neutrinos, not neutrons.",1
"Good, that clears everything up then! :)",1
"Oh yeah for sure, 100% agree, we’re just the universe observing itself, nothing else to it",1
And that's only because the light from the explosion was slowed down on the way to us.  The neutrons are unaffected by mass so they were not slowed down.,1
Maybe Ford Prefect learned how to say his original name.,1
"And my point is that, at best, we can give a range for how long ago it happened, but not a precise time. There are events for which we can't even specify in which order they happened.

"I had read that, that it would produce a light brighter than our moon for 2-3 weeks.",1
"I’m hella confused now lmfao, I don’t think so but pretty much what I was saying is that if we, here at Earth, we’re to see Betelgeuse’s supernova at New Years, it would mean that the actual event would have happened 642.5 years ago; however that time frame is very short when compared to the cosmic timescale",1
"Gamma ray bursters, on the other hand, could be dangerous at much greater distance.",1

I'm in too deep here - is that different from the time between the event of the light leaving Betelgeuse and the event of the light reaching Earth?,1
I don't have a retail store near me that would carry one so I guess I will order from Amazon and figure it out.  If not I will return it.,1

"Yeah, within that distance gamma rays from the supernova can be strong enough to cause chemical changes in our atmosphere and damage the ozone layer.

True! Until it is...,1

"Betelgeuse doesn't have a companion, so it's not possible to measure its mass directly by looking at its orbit. So, we need to use indirect means.

This is problematic, because Betelgeuse (like other dying stars) is not a well-defined stable compact ball like the Sun. Its outer layers are barely bound to the star at all, and it's shedding mass constantly. It's hard to distinguish what emissions are coming from its ejected nebula, and what's part of the main star, and hard to match what we're seeing to theoretical models because the evolution is too rapid and detail-dependent at this point. Is it model A at time t1 or model B at time t2 or model C at time t3? Hard to say.",1

"At peak it will be about as bright as the full Moon (but still a pinpoint of light like any star), so you could see it in daytime. It will be visible for months, maybe over a year, before it fades away and disappears from the sky.

"The shorter the lifespan of the star the more accurate the prediction of the supernova, so this means the 100,000 year prediction is more likely to be true.",1
I wonder if there will be any other warning that a supernova is imminent.,1
"It's almost the new year, so really it's more like 1 in 99,999",1
"Would the Earth be effected much, if at all?",1
Is this legit?,1
"Ehh, I’m not sure ‘lucky’ is the right word, I could go without extremely high gamma radiation bursts.",1
So naming my planet Plato would be good to go?,1
Ka boom,1
"Even better for the likelihood of a supernova sooner, right?",1
Stars as massive as Betelgeuse have a lifetime of tens of millions of years instead of billions..,1
"&gt;Obviously the chances of it going off in this year out of the 100,000 years are incredibly slim

Would you say that they're about 1 in 100,000?",1
I love how it looks like an eye as well,1
"&gt; I challenge you to pull up a single reputable source that uses science to determine how deadly climate change will be for the human race. There's too many variables to make accurate predictions like that. There's no way to know how bad or not it will be.

https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/ehp.9710584

A 30 second search shows that there is quite a bit of published literature on this subject.",1
Neither. Go read the sticky at r/telescopes.,1
"While you can't predict supernovae, this behavior is [most likely part of Betelgeuse's natural fainting](https://gizmodo.com/whats-going-on-with-betelgeuse-1840659793).",1
Yup. Forgot to mention that.,1
"Be cool if it happened on New Years, then it could be a Champagne Supernova.",1
Yea our Sun will become red giant at the end of life but it won't explode as supernova,1
"Haven’t read into it much, but I’m pretty sure it’s meant to go off in the next 100,000 years and not necessarily in exactly 100,000 years. Obviously the chances of it going off in this year out of the 100,000 years are incredibly slim, but it has to happen at some point. We can but hope anyway!",1
Binoculars are basic tools for astronomers. It's good way to start astronomy,1
"If this is your first telescope, I would not recommend either of these.  The EQ mount is not intuitave to use and can put the eyepiece and finder in uncomfortable viewing positions.  Plus the mount and tripod are too weak for the telescope and will be frustrating to point and move.  The mechanics have a lot of slop and play in them so getting the scope to stay where it's pointed will be problematic.  A much better beginnger scope would be either the AWB Onesky or Sky Watcher Heritage 130.",1
I assume 100 thousand years is very short in the billion year lifespan of a star so maybe the star is ready to go off. We’d be lucky to see a supernova in our lifetimes.,1
But our star will expand greatly before becoming a white dwarf. It will become bigger than the orbital path of earth.,1
That’s relatively short in astronomy terms. I’m hoping it’s either aliens or supernova.,1
"In simple terms, the reason some ""explode"" is that as they burn of material, they lose mass, hence they lose gravitional strength. Eventually enough mass is lost to no longer be able to hold the star (which is just gas, of course) together.  So it starts to expand.",1
"It's probably aliens. 

No but seriously, as cool as it would be, aren't the odds stacked pretty high against it? I'm no stellar astronomer, but even the article notes that BG isn't expected to go off for like 100,000 years.",1
"Not all stars explode at the end of their life. Some shrink and become White dwarfs. Our Sun will become a white dwarf. Google ""what makes a star go supernova?""",1
That's correct. Seems like a slight difference but you're increasing your light gathering ability significantly. Now understand I don't have experience with either of these scopes but I'm of the belief that when observing you want as big as reasonable. If you google the 130 vs the 114 there are many forums posts where people ask this exact question and get some very knowledgeable answers,1
These are all things you can and should be typing into Google.com,1
"Ask in r/telescopes. Some people call them Asstromasters, because reasons.",1
This didn’t go far,1
That means de 130 right?,1
You're going to want the bigger mirror.,1
"OK. I guess I don't have to ask what the cigar-like things in the cigar-box-looking box are. Ugh. No offense but I can't think of  worse way to spoil a clear night. 

Glad OP's family knows him well, though. 

(And yes, all you cigar smoking female astronomers can call me sexist, now.)",1
"I just looked this up and saw the same thing, I’d like to know from OP - absolutely stunning shot",1
"Thanks for your answer! Great website aswell, lead me through a nice rabbit hole of related content. Pretty set on getting a UHC filter first before anything else, just need to pick smth now. Does anybody truly know what they are bying into when making this choice? It feels like I have so much choice in band and wether I let H alpha/Beta/OIII pass additionnally. Kinda more lost them before :D",1
Toetally,1
"Ohhh. You were joking. I'm so sorry. I thought you were calling out OP for saying ""this is the first time you've ever seen this...."" when we HAVE seen it before just not in this resolution. So sorry!!!",1

"For your first nebula filter most recommend a UHC type filter.  Lumicon and Teleview UHC filters are among those considered top tier with the DGM NPB filter right there as well.  Light polltion has changed to a much more multi-wavelength issue in most places so filters called ""light pollution filters"" usually are minimal help at best and useless at worst.

I started with the DGM NPB filter and it does an amazing job on many popular nebula like the Lagoon and Swan.  For my second filter I added a good Oiii filter which works well on many planetary nebula and supernova remnants.

The best information I've found online for which filters work best with which objects can be found here: [https://www.prairieastronomyclub.org/?s=filters](https://www.prairieastronomyclub.org/?s=filters)",1
And did you get what you needed from it?,1
I came here for the toe.,1
"Between 100000 and 1000000 years from now. So “about to” in astronomy timescales, but highly unlikely in our lifetimes unfortunately.",1
"Get used to it, meteorologists can't predict anything further than 3 hours into the future.",1
I've always loved this nebula haha. Great photo!!!,1
"Stars don't get bigger and gradually more unstable because of the energy they are creating. For the majority of their life span stars are in a stable state and remain a consistent size. The fusion of elements in the core produces enough energy to stabilize the opposing gravitational collapse.

I could suspend my disbelief to read about a sci fi scenario where an intelligent civilization billions of years more advanced than us has somehow developed the technology to change the rate of fusion inside the core of a star, but that's fiction and nothing I believe we'll ever actually achieve in reality.",1
"The Bad Astronomer has a great episode on supernova https://youtu.be/PWx9DurgPn8 the iron question is answered about halfway through this episode. 

The entire series is great, but the episodes on stars are my favorite.",1
And I thought it rather resembled the nebula that have Bender tips on how to be a God.,1
"So as far as I know, it doesn't ever ""create too much energy"" to make it collapse. 

The very base interaction of a sun is turning hydrogen to helium. This fusion of atoms creates energy aka light and heat. Then more fusion happens with bigger and bigger atoms to create oxygen, magnesium, potassium etc.

Because bigger atoms are heavier, the bigger fusions happen towards the center of the sun. That energy pushes out all the lighter elements making the sun not collapse.

Eventually though the atoms become iron (now I can't remember why it's iron specifically so maybe someone else can fill in). Once things hit iron, they can't fuse anymore because the required energy to fuse is too high. Therefore there's no more fusion energy pushing all the lighter elements out from the center, so everything rushes into the center.

A solar mass is just a unit that represents the mass of our sun for comparison. A star with less than 8 solar masses becomes a dwarf star (usually red), higher than 8 makes a supernova, and around 25 generally makes black holes.

Those solar mass numbers may be slightly off but they're in the ballpark I believe.",1
clouds.. clouds is what to see.,1
r/forbiddensnack,1
nope,1
Hmmm. I think I like that.,1
"Nice man! Yeah I'm sure lots of folks have mentioned that a dob isn't ideal for imaging. I myself am selling the imaging scope that got me started in astrophotography and it tends to be the one I recommend to everyone when they're asling for good starter scopes, the william optics Zenithstar 61. Small widefield apo refractor so you'd get amazing framing on those targets and minimal trailing. Upgrading to a Meade quadruplet so we'll see ehat comes of that!",1
Didn't know Saudi hosts Ultra Music Festival,1
So... You can name a planet Bob?,1
Ya. I know.,1
"God I really need to finally get around and read that. I've managed to avoid any major spoilers and never watched any of the anime, so all I know is;

* There's a weird horse thing that does that terrible stuff

* Guts is The Black Swordsman, fuck Kirito

* Griffith isn't very nice

* Much like Hunter x Hunter, the boat trip never ends. 

Honestly I'm just gonna go start reading now. It's time, especially since I know it was a major influence on the story and style of Dark Souls.",1
"Cool ,the one ring that rules them all",1
I don’t understand that. Should not the same effect be happening to the moon as well?  Why should the sun be affected alone?,1
AhHhHhHH AAAAaAaaaah,1
What are you doing in Kuwait?,1
"It depends on when your photo was taken, but itxs probably Jupiter.",1
"Oh same, were you in Mushrif Park?",1
I view it from Singapore,1
"In addition to what others said, the sun appears bigger when it's closer to the horizon, so the moon can't cover it completely.",1
"Below are my list of apps and processing softwares (with links for quick access).

For my Google Pixel I use [Camera-FV5](https://www.camerafv5.com/)

I have recently tried the [astrophotography mode](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2019/11/smartphone-astrophotography-google-pixel-3/) on my Google Pixel 3 and it was amazing.  I was able to capture the Pleiades without a tripod.  Since you have a Pixel 4, put it on a tripod and take photos.  You'll be amazed.

[Smartphone astrophotography](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2018/07/smartphone-astrophotography-6-steps/) tips can be found all over Google.

Post processing:

For Deep Sky Objects I use [Deep Sky Stacker](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html) to stack the photos into one.  Then I use [StarTools](https://www.startools.org/) and finish with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

For Solar System Objects I use the following and in this order, [PIPP](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/), [AutoStakkert](https://www.autostakkert.com/), [Registax](https://www.astronomie.be/registax/), GIMP.

I started Astrophotography with a Newtonian telescope (Orion Astroview 6).  It works great for visual and my smartphone astrophotography.  I later modified it to [move prime focus](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2019/03/orion-astroview-6-equipment-spotlight-moving-prime-focus/) and now use it with a Canon EOS T3i camera.

As far as a guide to [buying a telescope](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2018/08/telescope-buying-guide/), this too is all over Google.  Probably the most popular topic to write an article in this space.  I recommend starting with a newtonian telescope and Star Parties are the best way to try before you buy.

Hope this helps.  Even as an amateur, there's a lot to this hobby.  The nice thing is you can to as little or as much as you desire.",1
"When the sun is closer to the horizon it appears bigger, so the moon can't cover it completely. Total dollar eclipses can only happen if the sun is high enough in the sky.",1
I got the reference,1
“Before you DIE......you see the ring.”,1
It reminds me of Berserk,1
It reminds me of the Dark Sign (and specifically it's appearance during the late game of DSIII) from Dark Souls. All it needs is the line of light flowing down.,1
"Object aren't on circle. Sun might be slightly closer and moon slightly further, giving you annular eclipses.",1
"It's not perfect. When the moon is slightly further way, the occlusion isn't complete.",1
"It's an anular eclipse, the moon is slightly further away than during a total eclipse. [Here's how it looks without the athmosphere distortion.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Annular_Eclipse._Taken_from_Middlegate%2C_Nevada_on_May_20%2C_2012.jpg)",1
I was able to see the complete eclipse from my region (South Asia). It was really amazing.,1
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire,1
"First thing i think of is ""wtf would ancient civilizations think it's happening right now""

This is petrifying",1
Welcome,1
Nah it's more about how close it is to the horizon relative to the viewer,1
"It may not be a moon, it could just be another star that just appeared brighter, or even a plane lol but even on my app, s.france at a SW its gotta be venus &amp; possibly saturn, but most likely venus n another star/flare or plane",1

Where are you?,1
Horus is watching you,1
"Sooo ""poopiter"" is a no fly?",1
That looks really sci-fi. Thanks OP!,1
Sun must be closer there: explains the heat,1
"Sorry for shit quality and reflection. We thought it could be Mars but I expected a red colour - this was very white. The smaller body seemed to move around but only in the lower right quadrant, didnt traverse the larger body but got closer then further away to the left. Any ideas?",1
Does sun look bigger when it close to equator?,1
"I’m really puzzled by this and wonder if a knowledgeable person can explain it. I’ve always thought that the sun and moon subtend (almost) the same ocular angle resulting in the sun’s occlusion during an eclipse. This video shows the sun almost twice the size of the moon.  

So what’s going on?  It can’t be a byproduct of the moon illusion (which is after all only an illusion).   Is it a effect of the exposure setting on the camera used, resulting in flare?  Or something else?",1
"One guy driving away at the height of the action:
""Whelp, guess that's that""",1

"I'm sad, according to an internet search I will not see a full solar eclipse in my lifetime unless I travel somewhere far away.",1
Wow.. Wonder why solar flairs aren’t visible in this?,1
"Telescope: Celestron Astromaster 130mm EQ.
Camera: Canon EOS 7D.",1
"If you look closely you’d see them, but that’s not the point of the video.",1
"the fact that our entire solar system and basically our reality is just a little dot like that when viewed from somewhere else, never fails to blow me away.",1
"Dont they have female humans in Saudi Arabia? I only see males in this video, watching the sun with their 3D-glasses!

(Edit: my syrian brother in-law topped it. He said, women there are too busy, preparing christmas dinner for the family :D )",1
"Same here, although the sun had managed to fully appear before disappearing behind the clouds above. It stayed for around 15 minutes.",1
Here in Mumbai watched it for a minute afterwards it was covered by clouds,1
Yeah that’s crazy. Looks totally different from the one I saw in early afternoon,1
Here in Mumbai I watched it for just a minute afterwards,1
One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.,1
"Oh my, this is breathtaking. Thank you for sharing.",1
7 days,1
The sun is at different distances from the earth during different seasons.,1
I live in Malaysia and only know about it after the solar eclipse happened,1
"That's great. This is my first time observing a solar eclipse. Here in Malaysia, it was very cloudy but I just pointed my telescope at the Sun and hoped for the best. This is one of the few pics I took without any clouds.",1
"Oh not at all I was just, referencing something, it’s stupid don’t worry about it lol.",1
"can you elaborate, is it related with ashen lights?",1
how is this even possible? i thought sun &amp; moon radius widths are nearly same from all locations on earth,1
You're lucky I couldn't see it,1
I'm confused for a moment because I thought you caught a picture of the moon.,1
Ashen one.....link the first flame,1
"Gear and Settings Used:

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm @300mm, 1/4000, F11-F22(depending on the time and phase of the eclipse), ISO 100, ND16+ND8 filter to lower the brightness of the Sun and to prevent any damage to the camera's sensor.",1
Dark Souls 3 is that you?,1
It's an effect of light hitting the atmosphere causing the sun's rays to bend making the moon look smaller (or the sun look bigger depending on how you feel) than it actually is.,1
Had to stay up all night so I wouldn’t miss it (6:30 Am). Worth it!,1

"No, it was in the morning. But there’s a lunar eclipse in two weeks or so.",1
"Wasn’t in Malaysia but Vietnam. We only had a partial eclipse, but it was the first one I’ve seen in about 5-6 years. It’s really beautiful, and I saw a bunch of people taking photos of it with their phones without a filter or anything. Mind you it was still rather sunny...",1
are u ok,1
Came here to say skydoughnut.,1
"Spooky!
Or should I say spooky-clipse?",1
Why would position change it’s relatively size?,1
"There's two eclipses that will pass through Texas around that time. An annular solar eclipse (like the one in the picture) on October 14, 2023, and a total solar eclipse (Sun completely covered) on April 8, 2024",1
Did Jupiter pop out?,1
"Amazing! The detail is incredible. I did some work up at the Teide Observatory a couple of years ago and even after stacking images we never got anything remotely close to this. Fantastic work!

I'm still waiting for someone to get some more images of NGC7212, a triple-merging system. I don't know why it's a favourite of mine, just is!",1
"Hold on a second pls... It's always 3 times:
Alright, Alright, Alllllright.",1
I never thought about the relative size of the sun based on its position in the sky affecting the appearance of a solar eclipse.  That's pretty neat.,1
This looks cool but now there's some chick tryna crawl out of my TV she's kinda soggy and pledafdgghbfs,1

Here is what I hope is a Holiday surprise... a nebula you have likely never seen before!

[\[Original Source\]](https://www.adamblockphotos.com/cw-tauri.html)

The Taurus Molecular Cloud time and again offers celestial beauty in its many folds. Shown here perhaps for the first time at this resolution and in color are the environs of CW Tauri. This star, just to the right of the other two that illuminate this dark pocket of dust, is like its neighbors very young and varies in its brightness dramatically. During the course of taking this picture it changed in its brightness by 2 magnitudes! The reddish jet to the right is likely an unknown Herbig-Haro object. So many subtle gifts in a single field.

It is perhaps fitting to release this image now since these stars epitomize new beginnings having just recently been born (on stellar times scales). We now approach a new year and a new decade with its own nascent hopes and aspirations. Special thanks to a friend who honored my (seemingly crazy) request and acquired the data for this wonderful object using his telescope.

With that I offer my best wishes to you during the Holidays and the start of the New Year!

P.S. I also included a small video at the original source showing the variability of CW Tauri.

What telescope do you have?

The problem with telescopes is that they come with very little instructions and show a small part of the sky :-) Besides moon and planets it's unlikely to stumble across something.

Also, there are a lot of free apps that literally show you where to look, thanks to the magnetometer and motion sensors in your smartphone.

On the computer, the free Stellarium is an amazing planetarium software.",1

Did the phone lens thing actually work as a telescope? I would imagine that the tiny aperture would be very problematic.,1
"Let's say you have a lovely 12 inch telescope, observing at ~500nm (visual light). Using the Rayleigh Criterion, that gives a smallest angular resolution of about 0.4 seconds of arc.

At the distance of the moon, 0.4 arcseconds corresponds to about 750m, and that's just to resolve something as being an object assuming it doesn't blend into its background.",1
"No, the main 7 stars of the Pleiades are super bright and visible even in Bortle 9. My guess is that you were looking in the wrong area. In all honesty, you shouldn’t need to star hop at all as the Pleiades can easily be seen with the naked eye.",1
Is this book good for the Southern Hemisphere too?,1
"Well it’s not “common” because there’s only one Orion, but Orion is one of the easiest constellations to learn because of the belt - it’s three stars in a straight line which is something you’d never normally see.",1
Nice is it a really common constellation cause that's the only one i know and i found it on my first day.,1
"That, my friend, is Orion",1
Yes the constellation is noticeable from the three stars in a line indicating where his belt would be. The Orion Nebula is right “below” the left most star in his belt. It appears as a blurry smudge,1
Yeah it’s my first proper telescope but I think you can get telescopes like this in the 400-700 euro range,1

Isn't that a Danish book,1
"Everybody's eyes are different and it can be hard to pick things out in a light polluted sky.

Your eyes are less sensitive to light when looking directly at something, try using averted vision (looking slightly to the side of where the object is) to use the more light-sensitive parts of your eye.",1
"You don’t need a high end telescope to see Venus, yet alone a telescope. Venus is super bright and can be seen with the naked eye (as you probably already know).

Venus is bright enough to be captured by a standard phone camera, but for better results, you should do long exposures. Do you have an iPhone? You can get NightCap for a couple of dollars, and will allow you to take long exposure photos which can capture stars and planets. Otherwise, you can point your phone at Venus and slide the exposure setting up until you see it (basically any phone from the past 5 years or so will have a camera powerful enough to do this). But Venus will appear as a bright white spot (just like how you see it from Earth).

If you want a close up view, then I think you’d be disappointed. From Earth, Venus only appears as a plain yellowish-white disc (with phases, so either a crescent or oval) with no visible surface details. And because of how low it is compared to the horizon, Venus will have lots of colour fringing as the atmosphere is so thick and distorts the light. The top and bottom will appear red/blue. The true beauty of Venus only shows up with physically close up shots, or shots in wavelengths other than visible light. 

If you wanna check out photos of planets and stuff, head to r/astrophotography, it’s a subreddit full of amateur astronomers who capture photos of space. But be warned, that hobby is very expensive.",1
Gorgeous! This was the first star cluster I saw when I began stargazing with binoculars. Will forever stay special to me!,1
thats a great present! im thinking about buying one myself ;),1

"Makes you wonder if living in the galactic center would be like the sun never set, because it’s so bright everywhere.",1

Not really. I think the company is about a 15 minutes drive away from the Netherlands.,1

"444 light years away from us are the Pleiades: a young star cluster that we see in Taurus. The cluster is around 15 light-years across and contains over 1,000 stars, but apparently only 14 can be seen with the naked eye.

In Japan these stars are called Subaru (of car brand and Mains Kea telescope fame). They have been known by many names and many cultures throughout history. There is evidence of the their importance to the Celts, Aztecs, Persians, Cherokee, the many Polynesian peoples - and so many more.

For me they were an early telescope target when I was 12, and I've loved them ever since!

This is my first attempt, instead of using 400mm and capture the whole nebula, I decided to use 714mm instead then stitch all 4 panes into one for better resolution and detail.   
I use DBE on the SII channel to even out the corners due to remaining vignette that dark frames and flat wont remove.

"The Orion, Running Man, Horsehead, and Flame Nebulae | 12-22-2019

I was able to grab a quick 45 minutes or so of Orion as he shot through a small gap in the trees and powerlines where I’m living this winter.

"Stunning. Pleiades are my favorite star cluster. A bunch of bright glowy blue giants 444 light years away, just being.",1
"Apollo used film cameras. If yo upping it at that sun, you’re not going to see anything else.",1
"Out of nowhere, the seeing was exceptional last night so I decided to re-shoot the Pleiades.

I think I did a much better job this time with the focus.

This is ~3 hours from bortle 7 skies.",1
"I just posted the results of my re-shoot last night. The histogram looked much better since the seeing conditions were above average.

I have been using just a canon dslr but I’ll be moving on to a dedicated planetary camera very soon.",1
"What equipment are you using?  This is my first imaging session with laptop control of my DSLR (using NINA). It can do a ""half flux radius"" calculation on the image which can help you get in focus with a number instead of just by looking at the image.  More quantitative than just using a bahtinov mask.

I try for about 1/3 on the histogram and this one turned out pretty good (2min exposures @ 800 ISO).  Here is the histogram for one of the subs: [https://imgur.com/a/PRoCoEC](https://imgur.com/a/PRoCoEC)

I think that will happen with Pleiades especially - super bright stars and if you're trying to get the cloud then your stars will be clipped.  That's ok, I think, as long as you are only clipping the small center of the brightest stars.

I did Pleiades one time at 60s exposures with ISO 1600 in my Bortle 6 sky.  What are you using?",1

"**Black Eye Galaxy**

The Black Eye Galaxy (also called Evil Eye Galaxy and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) is a relatively isolated spiral galaxy located 17 million light years away in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. It was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier in 1780. A dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus gave rise to its nicknames of the ""Black Eye"" or ""Evil Eye"" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance in small telescopes.

"First, get a copy of Turn Left at Orion.

Second, the ""lenses"" (called eyepieces) give you different magnifications, inversely to the focal length. 25mm gives the least magnfication and 4mm the least. The barlow lenses then multiply that up. 

Now the practial part. Magnification is the *least* important thing, quality of the image is much more important. That is determined in the first place, by the air around you (pollution, water vapor and movement, like from air rising from hot chimney vents), in the second place by the aperture of your scope (small in this case) and in the third place by the quality of all the lenses.

How high a magnification you can achieve will depend not so much on the numbers on the lenses but on these three factors.

Out of the box ignore the Barlow lenses. In this grade of telescope they are not of very good quality and will just degrade the image. Also ignore the erector lens, again it is just extra gralss in the way and the Moon doesn't care which way up it is.

With the very small aperture the 4mm will only be usable in exceptional atmospheric conditions, and in any case it is most likely the worst quality of the three eyepieces. 

The best magnification *for this scope* will be from the 12.5mm, but you may find (depending on the conditions) that the 25mm will give you better views on any particular night. Anyway uuse just these two, and try both on any given night.

And preferably take the scope outside rather than using it through an open window (warm air escaping will cause terrible distortions) or through glass.

Third, r/telescopes \- although they will probably tell you to get a Dobsonian (which is a good upgrade one you have the money).",1
"The 25mm would be the best. The erecting eyepiece and barlows are not needed nor desired as they will just degrade the image. The 4mm will likely exceed the telescopes useful magnifying power and it's small exit pupil size and eye relief will make it very difficult to use so I wouldn't use it either.  Just stick with the 25mm and 12.5mm for now.   

It is fortunate that you got this scope for free.  TBH,  scopes such as these are not recommended as a first scope for a beginner, yet most folks get something like this under the guise that they ""don't want to spend too much just to see if they like the hobby or not"".  When in fact, scopes like these usually turn people off to the hobby because the scope is so cheaply made that it is difficult to use and shows poor images of almost anything besides the moon.  Good telescopes are not cheap. A good beginner scope will run you a minimum of $200 which would get you either an AWB Onesky or Sky Watcher Heritage 130.  Just about everything that is on a tripod for under $500 is going to be poor quality.  

My recommendation would be to seek out your local astronomy [club](https://www.astroleague.org/astronomy-clubs-usa-state). They will be your best resource to getting started in the hobby. Most clubs host some kind of public viewing once a month where the public can look through a variety of telescopes and ask the owners questions about them. Many clubs also have spare telescopes members can borrow or check out like a library book that would be orders of magnitude better than what your friend gave you. Some clubs even have a ""junior"" club for school aged kids.  In addition, clubs typically host a monthly meeting where like minded folks can socialize, discuss the latest astronomy news, or invite a speaker to give a presentation on various subject matters. Usually it is during these meetings that the club will also have a new member orientation to talk about what things to look for when buying a scope, etc.   My club has a ""class"" that new members can attend during the monthly meetings where we take new members from knowing nothing to becoming expert observers of the sky and telescope use over the course of a year.  But a word of warning, most club members are elderly retired folks.  I tried to originally join my local club when I was 8 and was turned off because it was ""just a bunch if old folks"". But trust me, these ""old folks"" are a wealth of knowledge and are more than willing to take a newbie under their wing and show them the ropes.",1

Absolutely gorgeous...,1
"Set aside the image erect and barlow lenses.  Start with the 25mm eyepiece which will give you 32x. That will be the lowest power and easiest to find the moon with. Then once you've got the moon, take a look see what you can see, the try the next higher power eyepiece to see what that reveals.  Do look at the Moon at different phases, you will see different details. At full moon there are no shadows so its difficult to make out peaks and valleys.  And finally, it's always more rewarding to actually match up features to a moon map, so print one out. Good luck!",1

"Good question, I was told that every star you can see in the night sky is actually part of \*our\* galaxy (Milky Way).  The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is not, but all the stars around this picture are.

As for if there are any stars not part of a galaxy, that's a fascinating question.  Yes, there are.  When galaxies collide there will sometimes be stars that get pushed out of a galaxy.  I read somewhere that Hubble has found some, but I don't know much about it.  I presume that it isn't the norm, but it does happen.",1
"I was able to get some clear skies over winter break and got an image the Orion Nebula, Running Man Nebula, Flame Nebula, and Horsehead Nebula.

The Orion Nebula is a massive cloud of gas and dust around 1,300 light years from Earth and is located in the constellation of Orion. It is around 25 light years across and is the closest star forming region to Earth. Located 1,600 light-years away from Earth, the Running Man Nebula, vaguely resembles a colorful space ghost sprinting through the stars in the Orion constellation. The Horsehead Nebula is thought to be around 3 to 4 light years tall and 2 to 3 light years across. The Horsehead Nebula will eventually disperse due to ultra violet light from nearby stars evaporating its gas cloud. The Flame Nebula is about 900 to 1,500 light years away. The bright star Alnitak, the easternmost star in the Belt of Orion, shines energetic ultraviolet light into the Flame and this knocks electrons away from the great clouds of hydrogen gas that reside there.

"Sky surveys; take a picture of the exact same part of the sky at multiple times and look for changes. This is obviously not easy to do when telescope time is scheduled out and everyone wants to use them for their own experiments. It's become more elegant these days than just a person comparing two images, but I believe that's still the general concept to spotting new asteroids. There are some telescopes dedicated to identifying and tracking these objects but it's a really, really big sky.

These are relatively small objects and are very difficult to spot, so we miss *most* asteroids and some large ones (as in hundreds of meters... not the size of Texas like in Armageddon...) haven't been noticed until after they've passed or right before their closest approach. The trouble are the resources it would take for anywhere close to adequate coverage, and we've only just begun our very first mission as humanity to redirect an asteroid, but to use that technique we need to spot it early. For asteroids which we don't know exist or for which their orbital trajectories are uncertain, there's not much we can do. More money should be spent on tracking space debris and hazards, but the fact is it incidents happen so rarely and close calls happen so often people are normalized to it. Until something like the Chelyabinsk event happens, but on a much larger scale, people aren't going to do anything serious about it. We do what little we feel is necessary but  just like with SETI it is extremely difficult to fund something that",1

At about 3AM CST on the 22nd I was driving down the I-80 and saw a moon that looked like it had a green tail on the bottom. It looked off and I figured it was the windshield on the truck refracting some light. After 2 hours hour driving the highway made a turn and the moon was out my driver side window now. It still had that weird green light tail. I rolled down the window and realized it wasn't the glass. When we finally got to our load delivery in IL I showed my co worker and he saw it too. Couldnt get a picture so I drew on this one to show what we saw. Never seen anything like it before.,1

"Most countries will be under water, and Baron Trump the 3rd will be King of water world.",1
Well it's just because your comment was wrong and promoted misinformation. The sky is blue because of something called rayleigh scattering. Shorter wavelengths (like blue) are more easily scattered and reflected than longer wavelengths (red). That's also why the sky and sun look more orange/red at sunrise and sunset. The light has to travel through more atmosphere and the blue and green light is filtered scattered out bu the time it reaches your eyes. This wouldnt apply to a picture taken of saturn in space. But you can see instances of rayleigh scattering in some deep space objects like the pleiades. The dust surrounding that cluster reflects a lot of blue light.,1
"Because the whole ""science is settled"" argument is nonsensical bullshit. Further, most of the people talking about ""solutions"" are actually suggesting economic solutions that would kill or generally cause more pain to people than the slowly degrading environment would. Even if the science were settled, the economic solutions most certainly are not. 

A giant asteroid on a collision course with the planet is a fairly black and white affair. We can calculate with considerable accuracy precisely what the effects would be, including a rough death toll.

So in that case, you almost wouldn't even need the governments to do anything except get the fuck out of the way while various enterprises spent money on dealing with the problem. There are actually a fair amount of mitigation options *if* you detect the thing in time. Gravity tractor, kinetic impactor... Even nuclear weapons can be used. If you detonate powerful nuclear weapons close to the rock instead of inside it, you get a boat load of neutrons that smash into it at high speed and deliver a fair amount of energy that way. You can use these tactics in combination to push the thing where you need it to go, and hopefully you can change the trajectory sufficiently to get it off course before it's too late.",1

"I work on white dwarfs, so will do my best to answer! The electron-degenerate core is quite a long way below the photosphere, so doesn't particularly matter near the ""surface"". The ions in the core solidify after several Gyr of cooling, though the atmosphere remains as a gas/plasma. So if you were for some reason indestructible, you would certainly be inside the white dwarf before you reached any solid surface (and only for those with crystallised cores).

What the surface looks like depends on whether it is convective or radiative (much like main sequence stars). Convection reaches the surface as white dwarfs cool, but does so at a higher temperatures (less time spent cooling) if the atmosphere is helium-dominated rather than hydrogen-dominated. Therefore the main thing you'd see in these cases are convection cells. The size of the cells depends on the temperature and the white dwarf mass. Convection cells mean surface won't be completely flat -- I'm not completely certain on the cell height, but I imagine it'll be similar to the pressure scale height which varies from a few metres to a few hundred metres depending on temperature, composition and surface gravity.

"The whole star will start to collapse, since it's ultimately all held up by pressure from fusion that's no longer happening, but before the outer bits can make their way in, they are blown away by the explosion -- which is where the nebula comes from afterwards, all that material being thrown outward along with the heavy new fusion products from the explosion itself.",1

It's just a trait of optics and depending on the chemical makeup of the optical coatings, the flare will take on different appearances or colors.

In this case though, /u/blewcitychaser isn't quite right. I'm not 100% sure what it is, but it's more than likely ice surrounding Saturn's rings disturbed into a more diffuse orbit by the bigger moons.

Can you give more detail as to how you ruled this out?

I frequently see something similar to what you're describing.  I live near a major airport almost in-line with the landing pattern.  Sometimes, planes lined up in the distance appear pretty bright but they're so far away they don't look like they're moving.  You have to watch them for a few minutes to notice any movement.  You also don't see the red and green lights or flickering.  They look like Venus or Jupiter sometimes.

You say that you looked away, then when you looked back they were gone.  How long did you look away?  My first thought would be that it was a line of military planes practicing a maneuver or something.  In the time you looked away, then could have broken their formation and went separate ways making it appear as though they disappeared.",1

"As another person pointed out, the sun does emits light at many wavelengths (colors), and this combination of different colors across the color spectrum is by definition white light. If you want the specifics, the sun emits light as a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) of 5800K.

As for why it appears different colors.

**White in space:** This is the sun seen ""raw"", unfiltered by the Earth's atmosphere, so it appears white as explained above

**Blue in afternoon:** I don't know what you mean, the sun looks close to white perhaps slight yellow tint when high in the sky, but also don't look at it then because you can go blind. Anyway, the sun is being scattered by the earth's atmosphere, but not very much, as there is only like 10-20 miles of dense atmosphere for it to go through. This filtering/scattering is called [Raleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering)

**orange during sunset:** Same answer as above, except instead of looking though 10-20 miles of atmosphere you are looking through 500+ miles of atmosphere, so the effect of [Rayleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is far greater, and in short scatters the blue end of the spectrum, leaving red to reach your eyes and make the sun appear red.

**Yellow through telescope:** You are probably referring to the view of the sun through a solar telescope with a Hydrogen-Alpha (H-alpha) filter, which allows you to see solar flares, prominences, and other things in amazing detail. You can also get a *Baader* filter, which makes the sun appear white, and allows great viewing of sunspots.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** The apparent color of the sun depends on how much atmosphere you are looking though, with a redder color for more atmosphere due to [Rayleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering). If you are using a telescope it depends on what type of filter the telescope you are using has.",1

"Think of all the mediums it goes through: vacuum, atmosphere, glass, etc. And then some mediums refract and slow the light down.",1
"Firstly, I'd like to clarify that the sun technically doesn't have a ""colour"" like we associate with regular day to day objects. It emits light, which is how we perceive it's apparent colour. 

The light it produces is, indeed, white, although it emits the wavelength for green the most. During noon, the sun is closest to the earth with respect to the observer, as compared to sunset or sunrise when it is farthest. Try to imagine the horizon if its unclear. 
This change in distance alters the light that reaches you. Since red light is scattered the least due to the large wavelength, it alone reaches your eyes over large distances such as those it needs to cover during sunrise and sunset. At noon, yellow is much more visible. 

As for the telescope, I have no explanation. I'm just a high school physics student and this is my understanding. Would love to know if I'm incorrect!

"The both stars with the largest solar radii and stars with the highest ammount solar masses actually defy standard models of stellar evolution and formation, so its impossible to say.

As for the largest solar radii, because stars are so far away, while we can get a very good estimate range, we can't calculate their exact radii. The very largest stars in size are high-mass; unstable; dying stars called red supergiants, as well as their even larger; less stable; more luminous versions, the red hypergiants. Currently the contenders for the largest star in terms of size are UY Scuti, WOH G64, Westerlund 1-26, and VY Canis Majoris

In terms of mass, the highest mass stars (and also the hottest), are actually much smaller in size than even smaller red supergiants, but they are still absolute giants compared to our Sun. The highest mass stars ussually fall into one three categories of hot; luminous; star: wolf-rayets, blue hypergiants, or LBVs (luminous blue variables). The majority of the higher mass stars ussually range 25 to 80 times the mass of our sun, but some can get much, much larger. Eta Carinae A is somewhere between 90-150 solar masses (depending on the estimate), and the star with the highest known mass in the universe, R136A1, has a mass over 300 times that of the Sun's. There are two primary hypotheses on how the highest mass stars form. The first is that they go through normal star formation, but once they ignite into a star they never go through the normal main sequence phase of hydrogen to helium burning like most stars do, and instead they immediatley become a post-main sequence class of unstable star. The other is that two already unusally massive O-type main sequence stars may collide with each other, and the collective mass allows them to become these incredibly massive stars. However billions and billions and billions of years ago, very soon after the Big Bang and its aftermath, the first stars ignited. These stars would have almost certainly been incredibly massive, and may have reached masses of near 1,000x that of the Sun. As you might expect, they were probably blue with light peaks in the UV; very hot; unimaginably lumnious; and so short lived that they probably lived, died, and went supernova within only a few hundreds of thousands of years.",1

**Márohu and Boinayel, the star and exoplanet that puts the Dominican Republic on the astronomical map**

The fact that the Dominican Republic has managed to have two stars named after Taino culture in the universe places the country in the stratosphere, in the world astronomical map.

And this has been a feat achieved by a group of researchers, including journalist Marvin del Cid of Diario Libre, archaeologist and speleologist Domingo Abreu Collado and Mayté Vásquez, national coordinator at the IAU (International Astronomical Union).

The news was known this Tuesday morning, which immediately became a national joy, because now, officially a star and an exoplanet bear the names of two Taino deities: Márohu is the star and Boinayel the exoplanet.

The proposal was presented to the AIU by the journalist Marvin del Cid and in a short time it won the interest of the scientists, to become the winner of such initiative.

I see it and I don't even believe it

For Marvin del Cid, a journalist from Diario Libre who proposed the names, now official, of the new stars of the universe, having seen the proposal sent to the IAU come true is like a dream come true.

""I received the pleasant surprise that the names I proposed were the chosen ones. It's like I don't believe it yet. Maybe for many people this doesn't have so much meaning, but to know that as long as we are what we are as a civilization, that star and that planet are going to be called as I proposed, officially, for the whole world"", he says with his characteristic humility.

He commented that the idea arose when he attended to support Diario Libre's collaborators Henry Hidalgo and Darío Martínez to record a podcast they have in the newspaper, and that they had invited a member of the Dominican Astronomical Society (Astrodom), precisely to talk about the names of the new objects in the universe.

""When they started talking about that contest, I remembered the work I had done for Diario Libre about Márohu and Boinayel in the Cueva del Puente, and when I saw that they were two names (a star and a planet) and they were two characters that were closely related like the god of rain and the god of wind, and that are also embodied in the Cueva del Puente, I decided to investigate and present the proposal,"" he said.

Then he added: ""I want to thank Diario Libre for having published the article; Domingo Abreu Collado, because he was the one who rediscovered that cave that Fray Ramón Pané captured in the 16th century and 500 years later he found it. To Emilia Pereyra, who was the one who took me with Domingo to know the cave; to Luigi Morales, who was my second chamber; to Héctor Vilorio, who flew the drone inside the cave; to Henry and Darío; and to Mayté Vásquez, who is the link between Astrodom and the IAU, with which we have been able to put the country on the map of astronomy, which is very important"".

An incentive to research

For Mayté Vásquez, who is national coordinator at the IAU, it was very important as a nation to choose a Taino name, because this year is the International Year of Indigenous Languages, through UNESCO, and the IAU wanted it to be combined with what is being celebrated.

""With this, we had the opportunity to do it, the country was giving us the opportunity to choose Taino names because of our roots,"" he said.

And, he added: ""I think this is an incentive for young researchers and this is an achievement that shows that you can go one step higher and that's what the IAU was looking for in naming these objects.

And I definitely can not say what the odds would be if it is.

Highly unlikely, but theoretically possible.",1
"This makes sense, but given the sheer size of the universe, and the fact that it’s *technically possible, would you imagine a planet out there not spinning?

"It's not weeks or minutes, it's in between.

It takes a few months for the star to fuse all of it's oxygen into silicon.  When the oxygen supply is exhausted, the core collapses even further, and the intense pressure allows it to begin fusing silicon to iron.  The supply of silicon only lasts about a day.

After about a day producing iron, the silicon is exhausted, all fusion stops, and the outward pressure holding up the star disappears.  At this point it takes less than a second for the core to collapse and the star to explode.",1

LOL. I voice transcribed that sorry for the typos like futons. Physics man haha it’s a fun thing if you like it,1
Great shot. Is there a way to tell how far along along the star-creation process it currently is? How long does it take for a star to start/finish forming from nebula?,1
"Fantastic, what is that darker area up and right of the nebula?",1
"Ahh, awesome. Thanks!",1
Stars in the later phases of their life go through a lot of variability that we can’t fully explain yet. Read up on the great outburst of Eta Carinae in the 1800s for one example!,1

Awesome. Thanks!,1

Astronomer here! Not really. It’s also not likely to go supernova in your lifetime either.,1
"It has less to do with the speed of light, but rather how the scope compresses the light into a smaller area to make the nebula brighter than a conventional reflector.",1
"Is it, well obviously it is or why would it exist, that noticeable at such a small scale given the speed of light?  How long of exposure(s) did this take? Suppose that compounds it?

Genuinely fascinated. I work with fiber optics so i love understanding how light works no matter the application.",1
"I didn't know I stomped everyone, that's good to know.  :-)   My FOV is almost 2 degrees.",1
"And extra mirror will give the light a longer path to reach the camera.  This would help to give it more magnification, but because longer, it will slow the telescope down and make the nebula less bright over a specific period of time.",1
"I have nowhere the kind of money to buy a RASA but I looked at it and some of the advertisements and work done online, and you should too (though I imagine you have) so you can see how well you stomped nearly everyone, including many of the ones on Celestron's sites.  This is fantastic.  Clarity is great!  What's your FOV?  I don't see chromatic aberration or out-of-focus anywhere.  Nice.",1
"Hi! We don’t think Betelgeuse is likely to go supernova in our lifetimes as it probably still has tens of thousands of years, if not 100,000. It’s not even the star closest to going supernova- that honor goes to Eta Carinae. The trick is instead that Betelgeuse is in the northern hemisphere so it’s the closest to going supernova most people can see (Eta Car is pretty south), and we can’t 100% predict when supernovae will occur so we might be wrong.",1
"Maybe im just getting caught up in the name to much, but what does the extra mirror do to an image as opposed to yours?  


Thanks for the response!",1
"I have a 10"" cassegrian. Could i use the solar filter you listed on my telescope or do I need to have the identical setup?",1
Guess we’ll have to wait to see who’s right.,1
That would be a sight to see for sure. Doubt it will happen in my lifetime. Maybe just in time for Christmas? :D,1
Was it the same time of year? Or different times of year?,1
"Last time I looked this info up, I thought it was like a matter of a few weeks while it's fusing iron? That's still basically an instant in the grand scheme of things, but I thought it was longer than minutes.",1
Looks like a Boston album cover.,1
"Yes, but because there’s an equivalent between mass and energy they Still interact with gravitational fields. This is why you get things like gravitational lensing. In fact there’s an orbit around a black hole in which a photon will travel in the circular orbit forever, of course assuming the black hole is an equilibrium which they never are. However this is not why it takes millions of years for a futon to travel from the core of the star to the stellar envelope. That’s because foot on scatter off matter. Just like a particle of light reflects off any typical thing you can see with your eye, a photon traveling through a star will interact with atoms many times, being scattered, Absorbed or reemitted. What this means is that a photon takes what is called a random walk more less through the star slowly working its way from denser to less dense areas of the star before finally being emitted near the surface and taking its journey to our detectors",1
My understanding was that photons are massless?,1
"That’s really cool, nice work mate!",1
I have one of these. They do look really cool but battery life sucks sweaty ball sack.,1
"Yup! Amazing photo, btw",1
"Aaaah, thanks! I see it now. Hat is in the orange-ish color and even looks like there’s a hand extending to the right.. super cool",1
"Most estimates suggest it has a good 100000 years to go, and it isn't nearly that far away.",1
"I gather, pretty much the same. I think it could take 100’s of thousands to millions of years to even look like this. Totally living up to my user name here.",1
"Yeah, and I wonder what it will look like 500 years from now.",1
"There was no eclipse.

""Blood moon"" does not mean ""the moon looks red"", which can happen for a whole host of reasons.",1
I wonder what it looks like from the other side?,1
"Uh oh, did I just scare you out of it?  I heard the bigger RASA 11 can handle a specially made filter wheel.",1
"Also, I had never thought about how a filter wheel would block out the aperature in a RASA!

 *FACE PALM*

Thanks for that alone.",1
"Thanks.  If this helps, the Wizard is leaning back and he has a big pointy hat.",1
"Thanks.  I did only a small sliver of cropping because the three filters I used weren't perfectly lined up, but it wasn't because of any defects around the edges.",1
"lol, thanks much appreciated!",1
"Hello to Brazil, thanks for the compliment.",1
"The telescope was designed with a big 8-inch mirror (aperture), but with a very short focal length (the length in millimeters, 400mm, to where the image will be sharp when it hits the camera sensor).  The light is bouncing off of one less mirror than a typical reflector telescope.",1
"""I put on my robe and wizard nebula...""


Great shot!",1
"Well I would say it turned out pretty well for your first project on this particular scope.

Is this the full captured frame, or did you crop the image? I'm asking because I'm not seeing any aberration at the periphery.",1
Great shot mate,1
Can’t make out the wizard but this is beautiful!,1
"I love it, but it takes some getting used to because I don't have a filter wheel.  So I have to plan projects out a little better because I don't want to switch filters in the middle of the night.  But for my first image, I am really happy with how it turned out.",1
"What makes it ""high-speed""?",1
"That's a tremendous picture, mate! Greetings from Brazil. 

I use to see amateur pics everyday, and this one is very sharp! so good! Thanks!",1
"I've been looking at the C8 RASA, how do you like it overall now that you have the thing?",1
"Wow, that's a tremendous compliment, thanks!",1

One of the best pics I've ever seen! AMAZING!!!!,1
I get an existential crisis every time I browse this sub,1

I'm confused. How do I know which crater is the right one?,1
"lol, thanks I needed a good laugh  :-)",1
"It’s blown, just like my mind. 🤯🤯🤯",1
Damn. And my dumbass can barely take a decent photo of my cat.,1
If you are close to it....,1
"It’s 642 light years away... so if it’s about to blow in our observations, it already happened 642 years ago.",1
I believe it actually could be. Eventually.,1
It probably has already happened,1
Is it dangerous if it goes supernova?,1
"As much as I’d love to see it go supernova, the star seems to have a history of dramatic brightness differences. Also, according to the chemical composition, it’s supposed to have just entered the red giant stage, meaning it would have more time. [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse)",1
"That is very helpful, thanks. I have a tripod so I'll see if I can find an attachment for my binoculars. My phone is compatible from what I've gathered so I'll see which mount fits best for me.",1
Spectacular image! Congratulations.,1
"Stellar luminosity goes as L = 4&amp;pi;R^(2)&amp;sigma;T^4 , where R is stellar radius and T is the effective temperature (&amp;sigma; is just a constant). Decreasing R while holding T constant will have the effect of decreasing the luminosity of the star. I'm not familiar with what is currently happening with Betelgeuse, but if the radius changes on a faster timescale than the temperature, the star's luminosity will appear to decrease until  the temperature is able to readjust.",1

"The increase in pressure will allow an envelope around the core to begin fusing which wasn’t previously. But this envelope is not the whole core, which has likely already exhausted what fusion it can sustain.",1
"More like ""reflecting into"" the camera aperture.",1
"Technically you’re correct, but not when a star’s only fusion path is to iron. Even as the star shrinks and gets denser, it fails to fuse any more, because iron is the end of the road, so to speak. The pressure in the core will build until it reaches the threshold that sets off a supernova.",1
I just want to appreciate that `the.mob@harvard` email address in there.,1
"Possibly. I live in a Bortle 8 and can barely see it on a good night, but I know exactly where to look.",1
"Someone smarter is probably gonna append time this, and I welcome it, but I read somewhere recently that it’s because of all the wavelengths we can view, blue shows up above everything else, hence why our sky is blue. Same concept",1
"Bortles are rated from the best (1) to the worst (9).  According to what you read the answer is no since your skies are worse than Bortle 4, but these things have a lot of variables so the only way to really know for sure is to try it.  It won't be an easy find though probably requiring averted vision, knowing exactly where to look and some experience looking for threshold objects would be very useful.  It's possible that an experienced observer could spot it where an inexperienced observer would not.",1
"Shrinking means more density, thus more difficult fire the light to get to the surface and be ""released"".",1
A big part of how bright it appears is the angular size.,1
I have seen other images of the orion nebula that look a little different. I was wondering if this was due to the use of different filters to bring out color? I'm assuming that the original photo is in black and white....could be wrong though.,1
"So you insert the eyepiece into the hexagonal clamp, then tighten the clamp until it is snug around the end of the eyepiece.  The phone rests on the rectangular portion, and you line the phone camera up to the eyepiece.  I don't see why it wouldn't attach to one eyepiece of a binocular, though I haven't tried it myself.  You would likely want a tripod if doing this though.  Not sure just trying to hold them steady would work well.

The site should list the measurements of the clamp, which you can compare to your binocular eyepiece.  Also, you can choose between a small or big mount.",1
"Can anyone explain to me why shrinking would make a star dimmer? I thought shrinking means more pressure in the interior, thus more fusion and more energy to radiate over a smaller surface. So it should get brighter, shouldn't it? Or was that your point?",1
"I was just wondering about it. It was the one I came across most (in my budget) but I'm not really knowledged on things like this so I wondered what people with more knowledge thought of it! Do you happen to know how it attaches to the scope itself? Thats my main worry at this point, whether it will fit on my binoculars or not.",1
Yes - it is a good low cost choice for a phone mount.  Did you have any specific questions about it?,1
"But if it's reflecting off, then it would just vanish away into space, why or how is it causing the space to be bluish?",1
Ty,1
I always imagined Posidonius as dwarfing the craters around it. This has changed my perspective. Thanks for the post!,1
"If you know what you're looking for, you'll notice a persistent structure in versus the background light. This is because atmospheric light diffusion is variable (winds, humidity, etc.) as a function of time. It may be difficult, but possible.

That said, with a set of low-power binoculars, you might be able to see better structure. The key thing with those is that you want a balance between reasonable aperture and blocking out incidental light.",1
"""Dark sky"" areas can be surprisingly bright. I went to one near me and there was still a HUGE band of light coming from fucking Cleveland taking up a large portion of the sky. The sky was much darker than usual but I was surprised that THAT was considered ""Dark sky"".",1
"Cool, glad you think so.",1
This is super neat.,1

One of my favorite parts of astrophotography is combining raw data from my telescope and camera as it comes in so I can see the deep sky object begin to take shape. I thought it would be fun to make an animation of Bode's Galaxy (M81) as I combine more and more files together.

This animation consists of 37 frames running at 5fps. Most of the combining was done in increments of 20 raw images (some were shorter increments) ending at 560 total (each raw image had a 30 second exposure time).

"A planet can't be perfectly spherical, but that won't be needed if the axial tilt were actually 0 and its orbital plane, and that of all other planets, lie on its star's equatorial plane.

If you, on the other hand, manage to engineer a perfect sphere, which is totally feasible when planetary size is not required, there won't be precession at all in any condition, as precession itself is caused by the bulge. In other terms, you can launch a spinning billiard ball on any orbit in our solar system and it won't precess.",1
🤘,1
Because I wanted to post the unannotated version.,1
"I've been thinking about this on and off all day, and I think that a system like you describe is not possible. Even assuming a perfectly spherical planet (""assume a perfectly spherical cow"") and the exact orbit I described, no orbit would remain stable for long. Tiny perturbations accrue over time, from differences in tidal forces at different points in an orbit to collisions with other mass bodies in a system, which are guaranteed on astronomical timescales. Perhaps most significantly, what we know about how planets form indicates that orbits don't *develop* in such a way as to eliminate precession. There is simply too much entropy in developing systems to account for. All of these disruptions eventually overpower the parameters for a non-precessing body.",1

"Planets do exhibit different rates of precession, just as they exhibit different axial tilts. Mars takes 175,000 years do precess through 360 degrees, whereas Earth only takes 26,000 years. Check out [this page for more details about Martian orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_on_Mars#Long-term_variations).    
    
As for whether it's possible for a planet to exhibit no precession at all, I'm not sure. I guess it's theoretically possible if the planet were perfectly spherical and had an axial tilt of precisely 0 degrees (thus perfectly perpendicular to its plane of orbit, or ""upright""), and was orbiting exactly in the plane of its star. But I don't think planetary mass is every quite so even distributed and aligned to create that scenario in real life.

And large groups of galaxies seem to be traveling as well, together, towards something even more massive (The Great Attractor or, more recently hypothesized, the Shapely Attractor.)",1
You’re welcome. There’s a lot of great material on black holes and black hole accretion. Truly some of the most interesting objects in the universe.,1
"It’s definitely an interesting discussion. It’s hard to assume the affects that it might have. Especially given the fact that the conditions that are present in our location and the distribution of gas and dust clouds in our galaxy is going to be different from the conditions and distribution of another galaxy in which might have a quasar that we could study. Also, the distance to the closest quasar makes it hard to study those possible affects with any preciseness. I can see how forming any kind of agreement to theory has yet to become reality. It’s hard to get enough data and evidence to prove a theory, convincingly. At least, right now, that is. Technology will get us there. 

I’m definitely going to give that paper a read. Thank you for including it. 

Also, thank you for answering my questions and helping me learn and/or understand a little bit more.",1
Thank you! I guess I need to do some reading now,1
"No yeah I do know that our sun won't be affected by its gravity, but it's just weird to think other stars, probably way bigger than our sun orbit another object just the same way Earth orbits around Sol. Now imagine if these Stars have got planets around them, wonder how'd it effect them, getting so close to a black hole.",1
"Sorry, incorrect. It's the effects of scaling of the images to compress the dynamic range down to what we can see, combined with the fact that the atmosphere blurs things. Not lensing.

"No need to apologise for asking questions.

I know very little about planets. The affect of  Sgr A*'s previous epochs of activity would have on Galactic habitability has been studied a little. The main discussion is about if the ultraviolet would remove atmospheres. I can point you at references, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement. It's safe to say the Sun's position is probably a safe distance, but that may not be true if the AGN orientated in the direction of the Sun. The dust along the disk of the Galaxy might be enough to block it, but I don't know.

Hypothetically, if there were a quasar in our galaxy and it were directed towards us, would we be close enough that it would be detrimental to earth and life? That much radiation with that much force in such close (in a universal scale) proximity seems like a bad recipe.",1
Did you nuit it on internet or ?,1
"Well, SagA is just another astronomical body with mass. Imagine it as a massive star whose light we can't see. The other stars orbit around it just like they would anything else. Our star, Sol, is too far out to be significantly affected by SagA and instead follows the (seemingly undetermined) rules for galactic rotation.",1

"You can look some of this up of course, and may have.  Chromatic aberration is the phenomenon that high frequency light (violet) is bent more in lenses than low (red) so the colors end up in different places in the frame, and at different focus distances.  It's why in the image that you can see red and blue edges on the stars near the outside of the image but not at the center.  The red color image is slightly larger than the green and the blue is slightly smaller.   That APO took out some of the worse problems (like coma, which is the distortion of shapes of stars in the outer parts of frame - I see none!)  but it's stupidly expensive to build a scope that gets them all.  I've corrected stuff like this in Photoshop by separating out the colors and operating on them separately.  I don't know if you have ever done anything like that.  It's also occurred to me that some of the image processing packages might do it automatically.  

Keep taking pictures!",1
"It is definitely infrared, it was done with the NTT and the VLT which are visible infrared telescopes. ESO don't operate any x-ray telescopes. 

It's still not luminous enough to be a quasar of any sort. Type 2 AGN are not quasars, again it's not really luminous enough to be called an active galactic nuclei. 

&gt;I understand that not all black holes have quasars, but are quasars fairly common to see accompanying super-massive black holes?

No. A quasar is always a supermassive black hole, but only a tiny proportion of supermassive black holes are quasars. Quasars are rare objects, but almost every massive galaxy has a supermassive black hole.",1
"What I mean is that; Sun is a star, what we see here are stars, so how come they orbit around and our sun doesn't, is it thanks to the SagA?",1
"I'm not sure what you mean by ""explain to me how the stars that we see here have an orbit in general"" but as to the last part ""the stars that we see surely haven't got any planets orbiting them, right"" I would say why not! I'm not an astrophysicist but a black hole is no different than any other mass that something can orbit. It's all about inertial frames of reference. You may start to see some relativistic effects during periastron (closest point of approach) with the fastest moving start in that GIF, but even then it may need to be much greater for it to disturb an otherwise stable orbital system.

Remember, the sun is about 333,000 times the mass of Earth, but the moon doesn't care. :)",1
"Hmm I've got a question, hope it's not that dumb.. But explain to me how the stars that we see here have an orbit in general, they move around space and our sun is constant,and so the stars that we see surely haven't got any planets orbiting them, right?",1
"So is this an image in the infrared? 

Would weak emission-line quasars and/or type 2 quasars be relatively possible? Or would you consider this to still be far too dim? Also, I understand that not all black holes have quasars, but are quasars fairly common to see accompanying super-massive black holes?

"Have you read Dragon's Egg by Robert L. Forward?

""In science fiction there is only a handful of books that stretch the mind--and this is one of them.""--Arthur C. Clarke

In a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent lifeforms--the cheela--living on Dragon's Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time, men are their diligent teachers.

Praise for Dragon's Egg

""Bob Forward writes in the tradition of Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity and carries it a giant step (how else?) forward.""--Isaac Asimov

""Dragon's Egg is superb. I couldn't have written it; it required too much real physics.""--Larry Niven

""This is one for the real science-fiction fan.""--Frank Herbert

""Robert L. Forward tells a good story and asks a profound question. If we run into a race of creatures who live a hundred years while we live an hour, what can they say to us or we to them?""--Freeman J. Dyson

""Forward has impeccable scientific credentials, and . . . big, original, speculative ideas.",1

"Wow, good to know that, mate.",1
"Extinction from dust is a problem, which is why these observations can only be done in the near infrared. The effect of dust is something like 10 billion times stronger in the visible than the infrared for the Galactic Center.",1
"That's most likely a diffraction ring which is part of the [Airy Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk).

When light passes through an aperture it generates a diffraction effect like a bulls-eye/target pattern. Most of the energy of the light source is at the center of that bulls-eye but some of the energy is spread out in successive rings around the center. 

I suspect this is what we're seeing in the GIF of SagA. The star that wanders in on the left is bright enough to detect its first diffraction ring.

SPOILER ALERT: Of course this means we're not actually resolving round stars in that image, instead we're seeing Airy Disks. :)",1
It is the Milly Way.,1
"In the grander scheme of things, this has been going on for quite a while so the stars we see near SagA are likely to be ones with stable orbits. A 20-year window probably isn't long enough to see a stellar event. It might have been 4 billion years ago though.

This is also what's interesting about exoplanet research. You detect an exoplanet and characterize its orbital parameters. Then you run a simulation based on those parameters. If the orbit is unstable and the planet is ejected, either you're about to write a career defining paper or you got the orbital parameters wrong. It turns out that after a billion years the stellar systems that remain to be observed are likely to be the ones with stable orbits.",1
"It's all of them, but how much each star affects us is proportional to its mass and how far away it is. There are a small amount of stars between us and the edge of the Milky Way that cause a gravitational pull *away* from the centre, but this pull is counteracted by some of the pull *towards* the centre. Some stars pull us forward, some pull us back, some up, some down, but they roughly cancel each other out. Each object in the galaxy has its own pull on us, but the overall effect can be simplified into one pull towards the centre of mass.",1
"I've been going through articles, blog posts, Youtube and Ted talks for a couple of hours trying to find the answer to this. Everybody is focused solely on the blackhole and the closest star, I can't find a single source that even alludes to the other stars in the time lapse.

Personally I am leaning towards gravitational lensing, but I have nothing to back that up with.",1
"No, it's an artifact of the adaptive optics system which is being used to correct for the blurring of the atmosphere. With AO only some fraction of the light is corrected, and the rest is spread out in a big halo. It looks like some of the halo has been subtracted, but there are residuals.",1

"It's chaotic! You got it. Well, 'random' is the slightly more correct adjective if you're being pedantic. Stars in the inner few thousand light years in our galaxy have orbits that are randomly oriented instead of all being in the same plane like a disk.",1
Kinda puts things in perspective of how tiny we are.. Awesome post,1
I love how at this scale you can use suns as a unit of measurement because the difference in sizes between suns don't really matter that much when talking about galaxies.,1
What’s that flashing at the centre of mass? Is that coming from the accretion disk?,1
"Well, it's not hard to tell where it is, is it!?

Really nice!",1
"It's not actually lensing, lensing has not yet been detected in the Galactic Center as it's a subtle effect there (because the geometry is bad). Lensing works best when the lens is about halfway to the background object, in the Galactic Center the lens is right next to the source so the effect is small.

What you see in the image is just multiple sources merging together. This is probably a result a deconvolution, sharpening the image with post processing. You can see lots of close stars form 'bridges' which are nowhere near the black hole, so it's not lensing.",1
"ah i see, so it's not the nearby stars that pull our Sun along the curve of milky way, more like the millions of stars at the center?",1
What could be the star's speed at the proximity of the black hole?,1
"More like everyone’s orbiting around the center of mass of the galaxy as a whole. If you could precisely measure and locate all of the mass in the galaxy, you could pinpoint that center. You can think of it kind of like the “average location” of the entire galaxy’s mass. It’s likely to be pretty close to the central supermassive black hole, but not necessarily within it.",1
When macro world looks like micro world. We are just another part of another living organism.,1
"I’m thinking the few flashes that are seen in the image should be accretion by the black hole, correct? It looks to be originating exactly where the black hole would have to be based on the orbit of the star visually nearest to it (the star whipping around). Possibly OVV quasar? Or BAL quasar? 

Thoughts &amp; Theories?",1
"So we are gravitationally bound by the inner stars, and the inner stars gravitationally bound by the inner stars close to them and so on?",1
"I have so many questions.. 

1) Why is one star blinking in and out of existence in the center? Is it going _behind_ the black hole and that's why gets invisible? 

2) Why don't we see the accretion disk of the Sag A*? It must be pretty huge and pretty bright, right? 

3) What's happening at the left side of the stars? They look like they were thrown in a pond and are now generating waves. 


This is ridiculously cool to look at but just raised more questions for me then it answered.",1

Or are they just on the other side?,1
Ok.,1

There are two constants in that equation.  G is the gravitational constant. c is the speed of light.

So you can see that the radius is only dependent on the mass of the object - everything else is constants.  And the speed of light squared is a really, really, really big number on the bottom of that fraction.... so the Schwarzschild radius is a very small number.",1
you should see how orbital planes are derived from a chaotic gas cloud.  it's mind boggling but fundamentally quite simple.,1
People care more about things that aren't billions or trillions of miles away? Who would've thought.,1
what's going on top left with the flaring around that star?  is that gravitational lensing?,1
It’s so amazing I gave gold and I even don’t know why,1
"No problem, happy to help",1
"Sweet, thanks for all your replies. TiL",1
G is the gravitational constant. c is the speed of light.  They're just physical constants which as essentially a kind of unit conversion.,1

Rs=2GM/c^2,
So RS as in Schwarz Radius, what does G stand for cuz Im guessing M stands for SM, what about that c at the end.. Basically could you explain that bit to me",1
Its so unsatisfying that the video cuts out as the S2 star us on its approach,1
"Less of a chain reaction - the Milky Way has a centre of mass, and that's what everything is orbiting around. The centre of mass of an orbiting system is called a Barycentre, and the above is true of any orbiting system. For example the Moon orbits around the centre of mass of the Earth-Moon system. In much the same way, the Sun (and by extension the Solar System) orbits around the collective mass of everything in the Milky Way.

As a side note, centrifugal force doesn't come into play from an outside frame of reference, and most of the time isn't a relevant force. There is no ""outward force"", it's just the path the Solar system would take if gravity disappeared. The only force acting on it is gravity. Centrifugal force is only ever relevant when you are measuring from a spinning reference frame, in this case if you were measuring from the perspective of the Solar System.",1

"Yeah, because saying something is 10^30 kg is meaningless to pretty much everyone and doesn't really convey a sense of scale that can easily be pictured.  It's why we use light-years and parsecs instead of inches and cm (though, older astronomers still use cm often).",1

Sounds like a dumb question but what is the piece of tissue behind. It look so easy to do embroideries on it !!,1
"Damn, still helluva distance. So if our sun is 1.9 x10^30 and that number multiplied by 4x10^6? Would that be it? Is that correct? Or did I get it wrong",1
Yes. Its the speed thats impressive. Shows how much gravity is there. I think you misunderstood my comment as not understanding what was happening?,1
I'm emotionally bound to it at least. Keep on being massive giant black holy friend!,1
"It looks like the star moving so fast around it splits apart in the first frame. What’s going on with that, anyone?",1
Oh yes. It is neat cause it shows how extreme the gravity is to make it speedup so much.,1
"That’s what I was getting at. As the star gets closer to the black hole, the angular momentum has to be preserved. This results in the star gaining speed and moving faster through its orbit.

Space following the rules as usual 🙄",1
20 years time lapse = patience,1
Yeah not so much the orbit but the speed.,1
"The distance it won't be about to escape it's grasp is the last stable orbit around 3 Schwartzchild Radii.  Rs=2GM/c^2, mass is about 4x10^6 solar masses. Wolframalpha can do the rest.",1

Personally I thought it was a great environment with lots of supportive profs, and lots of interesting research going on that we had undergrads get really involved in.  Toronto also is *really* into outreach way more than the average astronomy department, so if that interests you at all there's a lot of fun astronomy events to volunteer at (like Astronomy on Tap).",1

"Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars with a beam of radiation, and we see the beam as the pulsar rotates every few seconds (or less). However, there is variation between the pulses themselves, thought to be due to secondary effects like scattering from material between us and the pulsar. If you take just a minute of data you can stack the signals and get the average shape of the signal characteristic to that particular pulsar. 

More on this famous plot, and how it ended up on a Joy Division album cover, can be found [here. ](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-the-science-behind-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover/)",1
I see telescopes often at thrift stores. Don't know if they're any good but you'll be much more likely to get something decent for cheaper than 100 pounds there.,1
"Now granted, the moon can blow you away even with a good cheap camera, but every budding astronomer never wants to JUST see the moon. They want to reach out to galaxies, planetary nebulae, globular clusters, planets.. all of which you’ll only get with decent sized telescopes, which in turn cost a bit (sometimes a lot) more money. The bigger the mirror on the telescope, the more bang for the buck you’ll get. At 4.5 inches like the one I suggested, planets will be very pretty provided they are up, and the brightest nebulae will be faintly visible. Up to 10+ inches is when people begin to get what is considered “excellent” views assuming you’re in a dark spot.",1
"Because telescopes under £100 tend to be toys, and at least binoculars can be used for other things too.",1
Thanks I'll check them out,1
"Thanks for replying. I'm surprised everyone is saying the same, funnily enough I just watched a YouTube video about a $30 telescope with 90X lens and I was pretty impressed the moon looked awesome.. I guess the $300+ telescopes would be unbelievable",1
I didn't even know they existed! Just looking at some on amazon now. Why would you pick binoculars over telescope?,1
"I’d recommend some binoculars for a rough and rugged familiarization of the sky. You won’t find any good telescopes under $150, honestly. The lowest price telescope that’s worthwhile that I always recommend beginners (as I began on this telescope) is the Alt-Az Orion 4.5 Starblast. It’s stupid easy to use, has an okay aperture for a beginner, and can be had for around $190.",1
"Yea it’s pretty amazing, as a kid I was always fascinated by it but never knew what it was.

It’s one of the few things out there that you can see with the naked eye even under light polluted skies.",1
"See r/telescopes sticky. Under £100 you'll pretty much only get toys, apart from maybe the [skywatcher heritage 76](https://stargazerslounge.com/topic/183695-skywatcher-heritage-76-mini-dob-first-light-review/), although I'd still be hesitant to call that anything other than toy.

"**Subaru Telescope**

Subaru Telescope (すばる望遠鏡, Subaru Bōenkyō) is the 8.2-meter (320 in) flagship telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, located at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. It is named after the open star cluster known in English as the Pleiades. It had the largest monolithic primary mirror in the world from its commission until 2005.

Great question! How dark were your skies? I was in a Bortle 3/4 zone with a predicted rate of 15 meteors per hour. Ideal conditions were predicted 18 per hour right before moon rise. I started setting up right after sunset which was 5:08 and packed up at 7:45 after the moon came up. Really only saw meteors for an hour once astronomical twilight ended. Sky guide is the app I use.

You can probably find a transform somewhere that will take out the rays on the bright stars.  The chromatic abberation you can kill by enlarging everything by 4x or something, calculating the actual difference in scale for the RGB channels and then separately scaling them so they are the same, then recompositing and reducing to whatever size you want.",1

Basically, nothing happens and since entropy is at its maximum you could say there's no arrow of time, so time also ends in some way.

To me, the question I ponder the most is about extraterrestrial life and its existance. I know all the probabilities and so indicate that it must exist but still it makes me wonder.

"**Capella**

Capella , designated α Aurigae (Latinized to Alpha Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega. A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning ""little goat"" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at 42.9 light-years (13.2 pc) from the Sun.

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L.

The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun.

***

**Regulus**

Regulus UK:  US: , designated α Leonis (Latinized to Alpha Leonis, abbreviated Alpha Leo, α Leo), is the brightest object in the constellation of Leo and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, lying approximately 79 light years from the Sun. Regulus appears singular, but is actually a quadruple star system composed of four stars that are organized into two pairs. The spectroscopic binary Regulus A consists of a blue-white main-sequence star and its companion, which has not yet been directly observed, but is probably a white dwarf. HD 87884 is separated from Regulus by 176″ and is itself a close pair.

***

**Gamma Leonis**

Gamma Leonis (γ Leonis, abbreviated Gamma Leo, γ Leo), formally named Algieba , is a binary star system in the constellation of Leo. In 2009, a planetary companion around the primary was announced.

Zero-energy (as I understand it) simply means the net energy of the universe is zero.

The traditional name Mizar derives from the Arabic المئزر miʼzar meaning 'apron; wrapper, covering, cover'. 

Alcor was originally Arabic سها‎ Suhā/Sohā, meaning either the ‘forgotten’ or ‘neglected’ one; notable as a faintly perceptible companion of Mizar.

 Got this picture a couple nights ago! Took around 600 pictures total from 6 pm to 8 pm. There was only about an hour where the meteors were visible and we saw around 15 just like the predicted rate for my area. Just happened to catch these 5 in my camera's field of view. Had to set my tripod up in the water to get a clear view without any branches in the way. Got a little nervous when a gator swam by so I didn't stick to close to the edge. Coaxing the reflections of the meteors out of the raw files was sorta difficult but with some brightening I ended up liking the result.

"""Rubin’s most important scientific contribution was establishing that the orbiting speeds of gas clouds in the outer parts of galaxies remain constant (i.e., “flat”) to distances well beyond the visible starlight, rather than declining as in the outer parts of our Solar System. High orbital speeds in the outer parts of galaxies imply the existence of extra matter at large radii. As a result of Rubin’s work and later studies, we now know that galaxies are surrounded by enormous invisible halos of matter containing 5/6 of the mass and extending ten times farther out than the visible regions. Numerous arguments show that this so-called “dark matter” must be fundamentally different from the ordinary, “baryonic” matter of the periodic table. Its nature is still unknown but is being pursued in numerous experiments in particle accelerators and particle detectors around the world. The realization that baryonic matter is only a trace component of the Universe revealed our understanding of the cosmos as shockingly incomplete and was one of the milestones that ushered in the era of modern cosmology.

Rubin’s second major scientific breakthrough, from about the same era, was a study of the Galaxy’s motion with respect to cosmic rest (Rubin, Thonnard, Ford, and Roberts, Astronomical Journal, 81, 719, 1976). At that time, it was widely believed that the expansion of the Universe was smooth and regular with deviations of individual galaxies of order 50 km s-1. Rubin and collaborators undertook to measure the peculiar motion of our Local Group of galaxies with respect to a shell of 96 spiral galaxies that were so distant they were plausibly at rest with respect to the rest of the Universe. The motion that they found, 454±125 km s-1, was nearly ten times larger than the standard value and was viewed as by some as cosmic heresy. Subsequent studies demonstrated that such studies are in fact highly complex, and this first value obtained by Rubin and colleagues is only marginally consistent with later values. Nevertheless, their paper boldly opened the subject, and large irregularities in the cosmic expansion are now part of standard cosmic lore. Indeed, they are induced by the much greater masses of superclusters of galaxies due to their large dark matter components.""

The work must continue.,1
"I am not gonna claim a know a lot about this, but that is just bad faith, like who said all she did was give it a name? I am pretty sure there would have been plenty experimental research and theory regarding this which she either was a significant part of or led.",1

Found my new wallpaper. 🙂,1
Postponed 48 hours,1
Awesome. Something about amateur astrophotography makes these things feel more real. Nice to see it in a new light,1
Thanks! Go for it!  It makes a perfect subject,1
"I love this, it turned out fantastic. I've spent so much time studying and replicating Orion, can't get enough of it - could I use this image to make a painting? I'm really digging the colors and overall composition.",1

"&gt; the eccentricity-value is totally new to me

While the seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth, the *length* of a season depends on the orbit's eccentricity. Since the Earth is closer to the Sun during boreal winter (perihelion is usually on January 4-5), not only it moves faster along its orbit but also the equinox points are closer to the winter solstice than to the summer one. The combined result of these effects is that winter lasts 88.98 days and summer lasts 93.66 days. It even graces the boreal hemisphere with milder winters and summers.",1
What kind of math? There's a lot of it haha,1
"There is only one correct answer there. All the other ones pertain to only certain moons.

You can figure this out.",1
Please answer it...,1
I can most certainly guarantee you that all this information is in your textbook.,1
"Sure, send them. Dude, you've never had pork, fish, shrimp, crab, clams or lobster. Yeah bro, you're missing out. I'm from California, where there is excellent seafood. I moved 2000 miles from the coast and I miss it. But out here, we have delicious deer. 

But seriously, you're English is spot on - so just start learning to code and teach yourself about IT systems - get your bachelor's, an internship and work experience in the computer industry and then move your ass to San Jose. You'll love it. Huge Indian community and they're all loving the American way of life. They all party like the world is going to end tomorrow. If you visit America, you won't go back. I worked with a lot of ppl from India, they all say the same shit - I visited the U.S. to work for only a 6 month contract, and I never went back and never will. I took my friend Nas who was from India, to his first heavy metal concert to see the band Lamb of God. He wasn't into music really before that. It wasn't his thing. After that night, he became a metal head and starter listening to it all and growing his hair out and getting tattoos. That concert was a life changer for him. He says he was reborn that night and I saved him. Lmao. I love your ppl - the ones that just let go and live freely. The older generation - they're a pain in the ass, but same goes for the older American generations. Aka ""boomers"" like my parents",1
"Additionally, when we wipe with toilet paper, we do what's called the wipe and check - those of us with good hygiene anyway. The wipe and check means - we wipe and look. If we see shit on the paper, we wipe and look again, and so on... because one wipe is never enough. Shit is like glitter - that's why I use a bidet at home. I wipe just to dry off. Still, if you're using your hand, you don't have that option or the comfort of knowing that you got it all. Not unless you do a double check with the right, but you guys only contaminate the left. Theres no way that it is an adequate method to sufficiently clean your ass or keep your underwear clean. Additionally, theres no way an Indian woman would wear a g string considering that this method is used. Because her underwear would be destroyed after one shit. 

Look at it this way - because of how you guys do it - it causes you to take some measures and limit the use of your left hand. You don't shake hands with it, touch your girlfriends face, eat with it, handle money with it. That means that you guys are well aware that it isn't a good hygiene practice. Shouldn't that be enough reason to change that? I mean, the hell with what the rest of everyone is doing. I don't agree with some of our traditions here. America loves pizza, and I can't fuck with it because its moldy puss and white blood cells from a cow's tit. And if Americans didn't use toilet paper, hell if the WORLD didn't use it - I'd be rich. Because I'd friggen invent it. And if no one bought it, oh well. Then I'd simply have the cleanest asshole and underwear in the world.",1
"If ur left handed they do the opposite. If you ever come to India ur always most welcome. Talking about beef I have no problem eating it even though I'm hindu. I haven't eaten any outher meat expect chicken and goat. Would love to go to US and eat turkey,beff and pork. Our younger generation in India is adpating Western culture slowly but deeply. As you can I'm writing it in English most young indians can talk to English to some extent. Personally I don't like Chess burger. I love the food my mother Cooke's would u like to see some pics of those?",1
"This object is so much fun to process that I can't wait to do it all over again once I receive a new reducer/flattener, which is causing the tilt that is responsible for the flawed appearance of the brightest stars. I combined exposures of various lengths to bring out detail from the core as well as the fainter, surrounding areas. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

The Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud. Some astrophysicists theorize that a small black hole exists in the middle of the core, also known as the Trapezium. Many of the filamentary structures visible in the featured image are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun. It can be found with the unaided eye just below and to the left of the easily identifiable belt of three stars in the popular constellation Orion. 

The Running Man Nebula, also known as NGC 1977, is also featured and vaguely resembles a colorful space ghost sprinting through the stars.  To see the Running Man, look at the left portion of the image, where dark regions laced with faint red emission from hydrogen atoms loosely carve the shape of an ""X"" inside the blue cloud. That ""X"" forms the running man's arms and legs.

"At home I use a bidet. I'm a trucker so I don't get that luxury on the road. My adopted cousin Bami told me that. I think I have a hard time telling whether or not Indians are being truthful. I mean even the body language - you guys shake your head when you're nodding yes. Lmao. But yeah, culture differences are different. But regardless of culture I just go by what makes sense and throw the rest away. 

There are some American cultures that I don't go along with. Like dairy and honey for instance. I'm not lactose intonlerant or diabetic but I sure as hell ain't going to put another animal's body fluid in my mouth. Not milk, yogurt, cheese, or partially digested insect vomit. Milk consists of puss and blood plasma, why the fuck would I put that in my mouth and ingest that? Meat is one thing. But fluid? Hell no. Just because it's been a staple for thousands of years doesn't mean that everything that people did thousands of years ago was a great idea. The Roman's brushed their teeth with piss thousands of years ago. But hey, at least they used their own piss. Point is, even if using toilet paper feels disgusting on your ass, doesn't it beat the alternative of how it makes your hand feel when you dont? Plus why would you want to restrict the use of your hand? Soap only goes so far. It's not a guarantee that you won't give yourself pink eye when you're washing your face. I'd love to visit India, but not if I can't buy toilet paper or at least wet wipes. You guys do everything right for the most part. Except you guys won't eat meat from bovine, and you'll avoid ice and toilet paper. Ice and beef is no biggie. But toilet paper? I don't think you guys thought that through very well. And considering your population, I find it awfully hubristic that ice is avoided because it's considered filthy, and toilet paper is avoided for the same reason. Lol. You all need to have a cheeseburger/ beer festival and have the bathrooms and Porto potties equipped with toilet paper. Wth do you guys do at outdoor music festivals or construction sites when there's no bathrooms with soap and sinks and just porto potties? Dare I ask? And what if you're left handed?",1

My guess is satellite re entry.,1
What did you use? A phone? Or SLR?,1
"With no zoom? There's no way. You didn't have a star map running on your phone when you took the picture? So obviously you preset the exposure time for 16 seconds then, so you couldn't have accidentally done a screenshot or touch the phone. Because a low shutter speed blurs very easy. I took photography in college so I know that's your f stops are spot on. I'm deep in the Ozarks of Missouri. And I have high visibility too. And our latitude lines aren't that far from eachother. You and I see the same sky. And Andromeda is not only too dim for the exposure, it's too small to be seen like that without an optical lens with zoom. And a $4 tripod isn't sturdy enough for that kind of zoom. There's just no way bro.",1
First of all not only impoverished but also rich people in india uses water and soap instead of toilet paper. I also do use water and soap most Indians do it.  Cause using toilet paper in India fells kind of disgusting. It's like what you fell about Indians using water instead of toilet paper is our felling for Westerns like US and Europe. Don't worry we use our left hand to clean our butt and use soap. And use Right hand to eat. That's why we don't give money by our left hand in India. U can ask me more questions by massage in me in the profile.,1
Where I live light pollution is low. I didn't used any lense I just saw a tutorial video on YouTube bought a tripod which was like 4$. I set it up and pointed towards Andromeda and clicked the photo the expouser was like 16 sec. Iso 800. What do you think is that really Andromeda or something eles?,1
And is it true that the impoverished people of New Delhi don't use toilet paper when they wipe their butts? Serious question.,1
"Dude. Oh hell no. You're just a kid? Yes, not thinking causes trouble. You need to change that shit. You don't need to overthink it, but even that beats no thought into it.

The only thing that was enhanced is the ridiculousness of the post with your use of pedantic ""Engrish"" of your misleading description in the post's title Walmart guy. Fire? I'd hardly call it a burn. Here's a burn on character -

Wtf is with your profile name? Seriously. Is it because you work there? Because I hardly that as reason to make a profile name out of it. It's understandable if college students and the elderly work there, but even still - I wouldn't even advertise that detail in my 'about info' on Facebook, let alone call myself ""that Walmart guy."" Especially if you're a Walmart lifer. Thats even worse. It's not a career. At best, it's a stepping stone for students and an extra income for the retired. When I worked at Trader Joe's and people asked me what field of work I was in - I'd tell them I was in school as an econ major and a shortstop on the school's team roster. Didn't bother including the fact that I worked at grocery store - because it's intellectually constipating and insignificant. ""That foreman guy"" or ""That field-tech guy""? - I'd get it.

"Messier 42, the mighty Orion Nebula.


This is by far my best picture I've ever take so far from a DSO. I remember watching a video from Astrobackyard about the Orion Nebula. After that video I bought a Skywatcher Star Adventurer and used my canon 760d with an old canon 18-55 kit lens. The first frame was a 30 second iso 3200 f5,8 and when I saw the frame for the first time I almost screamed. The downside was that this was at the end of winter when the nebula already was close to the horizon at it's highest point. 


Now almost a year later I made this one. This image is take from data that I captured over several nights five to be precise. I'm having trouble getting longer exposures than ~20 seconds at the moment while just a couple of months ago I got around 120-130 seconds with the same equipment. My polar aligment is fine for as far as I can see, it's correctly balanced and the tripod is level. The reticle is in the center of the scope, I checked this by centering it on a streetlight during the day while rotating the RA Axis. The clutches are all tight and the motor isn't spinning faster or slower than it should be. I checked this by setting it up at the side of the desk and letting it run for 24 hours recording its start and the end position. A friend of mine suggested opening the mount and grease the gears a bit. Another thing I noticed is that the DSO seems to move quite a bit while scrolling fast trough the frames. It's like at one point the mount thinks that's it's behind and needs to keep up, and the next frame it thinks it's infront and needs to slow down again. I know it's supposed to do this a bit, but I think it's a bit to much movement.



Anyways, I used the following equipment:

Canon 760D

ISO 200

Skywatcher Star Adventure

Skywatcher evostar 72ed 420mm f5,8

823 times 20 seconds light frames.

80 dark frames

80 flat frames

80 bias frames


Processing details:

I started with manually going through every frame and deleting the ones with star trailing, comets, satellites, clouds, etc. After that I started stacking them in DeepSkyStacker 4.2.2 with the suggested setting. This took a long time because of the 1063 frames. After it finished stacking I exported it as a 32 bit rational and imported it in Adobe Photoshop CC 2019.

I started with a threshold layer to see with what kind of data I was working with and set a dark point for background calibration. After the threshold layer I picked a bright star and started adjusting the colors so all the colors where at the same value +- 3. The next thing was cropping the image to frame the nebula in the center and removing stacking artifacts at the corner. Before I start cropping I changed the image to 16 bit, after that I did an extreme curve stretch to brighten the corners so I know how far I needed to crop the image. After the crop I removed the curve stretch and opened s new curve adjustment layer, with this layer I started bringing the nebula forward while keeping a correct color balance. I did this about 9 times until I got the nebula quite how I like it. After these 9 curve stretches I tried bringing the faint nebulosity forward by editing each color individually. The next thing was a star minimize and some noise removal. The last thing I did was removing the blue/purple hallos around some star with the lens correction feature in the camera raw filter.",1

"&gt;But what I don't understand is how we are able to see the Andromeda galaxy without a problem - it being way outside of that ""viewable circle""

So that circle, roughly 10,000 light years in radius, is where all the *stars* we can see are. The Andromeda galaxy isn't a star though, it's a collection of about a trillion stars, so of course it's going to be much, much brighter than a single star. Since it's brighter, we can see it from farther away.",1
"To an extent: it has more seemed to me like a theory outlining the initial development of the universe with rapid expansion of space-time, the eventual formation of matter, and subsequent evolution.

As for how it started off in the first place, we don't claim to know. It is analogous to biological evolution. We have a reasonable explanation for development, but not the outright origin, though there are hypotheses.",1
"Thanks alot. I'm actually out in the field right now and calibrating. I got it up to 3 minutes already! Will see what's possible.

The big wheel moves to set your right ascension and the small one the declination. The RA wheel is aligned with Polaris (earth rotation pole to be precise). The RA wheel is then also slowly turned to track.

The cone shapes are attached fixed to the camera and the smaller wheel. They're just shaped this way for more sturdyness. 

Funny enough, it's sufficient to use the steppers in full step mode, not even half step. I could use half step but I get some more torque out of them this way.",1
"That is very cool. 2 minute subs with any tracker at that FL are good.

Does the big wheel rotate to set your elevation, then you move the base to set the azimuth?  And are the 2 cone shaped pieces the RA axis so that is what turns during an exposure?  

Do the RA steppers microstep?",1

"Hundreds of thousands of scientists have made significant discoveries in their own field.

These are people who discovered the absolute fundamentals of the field up to several centuries ago. 

The reality is that scientific knowledge developed by men and women are almost entirely not contributed except in papers authors/nobel prizes. Those that are historically celebrated are the most notable, the top 0.001%, and are rarities for both sexes.",1
"Always be ware of statements that say ""we can see so far"" and give measures or circles.  Usually these are terrible oversimplifications.  I don't know if you play tabletop RPGs but their rules are also horrible about this kind of thing.  There are too many factors determining visibility.  In addition to distance there is brightness, and different people have different sensitivity that can double or half the range at which one can see an object of a particular brightness.  This obscuring dust is something you can see.  If you get to dark skies and look at the center of the Milky Way (in Sagittarius) when it is high enough to see the whole thing, you will notice that the center is irregular and dark.  This is the dust.  But of course, you can see farther above and below the dust lane, which functions just like a terrestrial cloud blocking part of the sky.  As for things like the Andromeda Galaxy, now you are getting the benefit of it being out in a direction where there is not sufficient dust to block the light much, and in addition, the stars appear so close together at that distance that each photoreceptor in our eyes is picking up light from many stars, and their combined brightness is enough to see.  This is also why it appears to be a fuzzy blob.  If you can't see single stars separately, it is just haze.  Fog is also made of tiny particles, but they are too small to see individually.  That analogy is carried off in the term for such ""clouds"" of stars: nebula.  This is Latin for ""fog patch"" or ""little cloud.""",1
"I have been thinking of Doping something similar  but haven't gotten around to it yet.

Could you post your math for this project?",1
"There are traditional ancient names, like those for the planets or particularly bright stars like Rigel, Mizar or Antares. Starting around the invention of the telescope (late 1500s and after) an effort was made to catalog stars. Several systems were developed.  Bayer used Greek letters followed by the constellation name (Alpha Centauri). John Flamsteed used a # followed by the constellation name (55 Cancri).  There were several others but those two are the most common we still see in use. Those systems can overlap and a [star have names in all three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Orion): Rigel is also Beta Orionis and 19 Orionis. The brighter the star the more likely it has multiple designations. 

As equipment got even better we surpassed any system using simple numbers and letters and newer catalogs (Henry Draper or HD) and satellites like Hipparchos use large numbers like 24436 to designate Rigel. Seeing a reference to an HD ### star is not uncommon since that catalog covered 225,300 stars. Eventually even these systems exceeded capacity and even more distant starts are often just referred to by designation which reference their place in the Celestial coordinate system: [WISE J0521+1025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISE_J0521%2B1025) and whatever survey recorded it.

As far as galaxies their names didn't start until a few hundred years later. The first major system we use is Messier Catalog of objects. These were object he recorded while looking for comets that weren't comets but could be confused with one. His objects are M# like M31 for the Andromeda Galaxy or M42 for the Orion Nebula.  No distinction is made between types, he didn't have the capability to determine if an object was a galaxy, cluster or nebula. After Messier the next most common catalog of deep sky objects is the [New General Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalogue) which produces NGC numbers like NGC 1976 for the Orion Nebula. A number of the objects in both catalogs (which overlap) have common names.

As you get into more obscure objects there are specific catalogs that have been compiled. For example the [Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_Catalog_of_Planetary_Nebulae) or the [Bernard Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_Catalogue) or dark nebula. 

Even these no longer suffice and again for more distant galaxies and we have fallen into more obscure systems of based on location, catalog, type of object and other factors that often take looking up in the specific catalogs reference portion to determine how the name was arrived at.  

The International Astronomical Union is a collection of scientists and the recognized authority in naming objects. They have [pages in naming](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/) but tend to focus on in solar system objects beyond providing general guidelines for catalogs.",1

"That's not true at all. Not many women really accomplished anything extraordinary before the mid 1900's, and the women that have made strides in science are just like any other scientist, advancing science like normal, and get complete credit for what they contributed. If a scientific feat is interesting enough to share, the person that did it gets the credit, whether or not they're female; that part doesn't just get left out. Just because you can't think of any super-geniuses like a female Einstein or Newton doesn't mean that women don't get credit for their scientific accomplishments. Just look at the black hole photo from earlier this year; the media and majority of the population was pretending like the one female on the team did all the work and ignored every other member of the team.",1

"&gt; Sort of like humans going into space will eventually be able to float because they are no longer experiencing enough of earths gravity to plant them solidly to their spacecraft

This is not at all how ""floating"" works in space.  At any point in space, if you are not under thrust from a spaceship, then you are falling and thus weightless.  This is true both of spaceships just outside Earth's atmosphere and spaceships halfway to the Moon.  In fact, the Moon is a good example of how strong Earth's gravitational pull is - it keeps the Moon in orbit even from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away.  And Earth's gravity continues indefinitely.  It's just that if you go far enough away, the main force you experience--i.e., the direction you ""fall""--will shift to be around the Sun, not back to Earth.

See further: https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/

That said, the description of gas breaking away from the expanding red giant star still checks out.  But your description of floating in space is a common misconception.",1
"Not by much. If the haze of our galactic plane gets closer, it doesn't get brighter, it just takes up more area of sky. This would not detract from the development of astronomy, though we may eventually have some difficulty in studying objects beyond our galaxy",1
"Well yes, but the reason women did said work was because it was unseemly for them to actually stay up at night and use the telescope. And you didn’t have to pay them as much!

Fun fact though, the building the plates are in was built to store them, and had tall windows. Because there was no electricity at the time so you were examining them at daylight in a special contraption to catch even more light. It’s pretty amazing how much science was accomplished before electricity.",1

"One reason we can't see more in our galaxy is all that we have to look through all the dust that's in it, and individual stars only give out so much light. For individual stars the furthest visible are only a few thousand light years away, but include things like star clusters and we can see things significantly further, like the Hercules globular cluster 22,000 light years away. We can't resolve individual stars in these, but we can still see them as a fuzzy blob.

Inside our galaxy there isn't much else that will have a large enough concentration of stars to be visible through the dust and against the hazy glow of all the other stars in the galaxy. Though another example is the Sagittarius Star Cloud, which is less of an 'object' and more a hole in the dust in our galaxy that we can see a distant region of denser stars through, starting around 10,000 light years away.

But when looking at things outside our galaxy, like the Magellanic Clouds or Andromeda, we aren't looking through the 'disk' of the Milky Way where most all of the dust is, and there's less of a 'background' of distant stars in the galaxy to stand out against.",1
"As I mentioned, this isn't in its final version. I want to test this further to make sure it won't break under any circumstances with anyone's expensive camera attached. There's also some things I'm not satisfied with yet and want to improve further. Hope you can understand. 

 If you're determined to help me testing, write me a message. But you mentioned you don't have a printer yourself, that might be a problem as some parts will change and you'd have to print them again and again.

"I like to imagine that I am standing at the edge of a fog. I can't see too far into the fog, but I can see for miles in the other direction. Likewise, the fog is our Galaxy as we can't see too far into it. Due to being at the edge of the fog however we can see objects much farther away.

This has got me thinking.  If Earth was positioned closer to the center of the Galaxy, we would experience more obscured views of the universe. We could really only see objects above and below the galactic plane.",1

Andromeda is about 90 degrees off the plane of our galaxy, so at the start you have much less matter in the way (which is one of the reasons that the black hole in M87 was targeted for that photo). Secondly, it's not a sharp point like a star. If you've seen it from a dark site with the naked eye it's more like a faint grey smear, and its bright enough to stand out against the darker background of space. It may be much further away, but it's also the combined starlight of about a trillion stars.",1

They still have about 200,000 plates to digitize, so it will take a few more years.

Smartphones, no matter what megapixel their camera is, make pretty poor devices to astrophotography, especially without a scope. The problem you're going to have is the aperture just isn't big enough to capture enough light to see anything clearly.

"I don't know absoloutley everything about white dwarves. However if tried walking around on one, the gravitational force would instantly crush you down, and the heat would melt you, and your melted matter would soon vaproize. Neutron stars are far more interesting, like white dwarves, they are crushed down dead star cores made of degenerate matter. However they are far more dense than even white dwarves, and because it is an astronomical ammount of mass packed into an area the size of large city, the gravity is ridicolous, and you would see similar light bending/warping effects of the starlight behind you, similar to a black hole, but slightly less extreme. Like a white dwarf, you would instantly die, except faster, instantly becoming compressed vapor, and thats if you were not already burned to a crisp by the intense radiation or ripped apart by the magnetic field, if this neutron star was a magnetar. If you could somehow survive the surface of a neutron star (you cannot, like at all), you find that the crust is a relativley very thin layer of electrons and ionized atoms of iron, whereas the mantle immediatley below you and down to the core, would be made of a liquid-like substance known as neutronium: bassically a fluid of degenerate neutrons in a sort of ""melty"" state. No one is quite sure what the core of a neutron star is made of, but there are some theories it might be composed of an exotic substance known as strange matter. Some theories further suggest that if strange matter came into contact with the normal matter that dust clouds, galaxies, stars, planets, life, and you and me are made of, that it our matter would naturally react with that strange matter, to become more like it, and like a virus, strange matter could spread to everything and destroy it. If strange matter does exist, we are probably safe, since neutron stars regularly expierence violent tectonic events known as star quakes, which subduct any surface material and reset the star's surface.",1
It’s mirach,1
"theres no way you captured andromeda in a bortle 6 sky, without any telescope. I don’t even get how that’s possible for Saturn.",1

Andromeda is bigger than the full moon in the night sky in terms of its actual apparent diameter...but because its so distant and faint, and you would need to collect a ton of light from it to get a nice exposure, and that would include the still very faraway, but much closer stars of our local celestial neighborhood. If this was the Andromeda galaxy, you would have hundreds of bright stars in the picture. You do have something in there, but its probably the planet Saturn, which obviously millions of light years closer to us than Andromeda, right in our own interplanterary ""backyard.""",1
"Well if it's in the same spot as Andromeda, and your star apps tell you that it is, I'm thinking that you got a picture of Mirach (a star) and not the galaxy. That, or Saturn. I looked in Stellarium (free planetarium software) and the stars in it match the stars in this image.",1
"Thank you for you reply, this image was taken today 16 th of December. You can see the star popping up because it's not the raw image.

If you need more proof you can download any star tracker app and type the location  shyamnagar,West Bengal,india. And see it yourself sir. I truly respect your opinion.",1
Not a bad picture of Saturn. With a cell phone too!,1
"Hey, still impressive to see Saturn with the phone tho...",1
"The object is too sharp, no matter what instrument you used. It doesn't make sense that your camera managed to capture the light from blurry Andromeda but the rest of the picture is pretty black. Usually there is quite much light smog from the stars of Milky Way. Also, despite low quality, it looks way out of proportion to the stars.",1
"If u havnt even used a scope then it can also not be Saturn imo, forget about andromeda.",1
"Thats honestly really impressive. I don't know what instrument you were using, but while the Andromeda galaxy is as big as the moon in apparent diamater, to collect that much light from it to form a picture like that must have taken a ton of work.",1
"OP has also mentioned below that he didn’t use any scope, lol.  In that case it can also not be Saturn imo.",1
"Bra, thats saturn and a shit picture of it at that.",1
"Because what your looking at in the photo is probably Saturn positioned in front of, or nearby to, Andromeda, which is far too dim to see on a phone camera.",1
 That’s definitely Saturn.,1
"This doesn't look like the Andromeda Galaxy to me, it looks like Saturn.

The Andromeda Galaxy is the brightest of the Messier objects, but its not that bright, especially compared to the surrounding stars. It has an apparent magnitude of 3.4 while the nearby star Mirach has a magnitude of 2.  Mirach should be popping out in this image, as should other stars in the 2-3 range as others have noted. Also, the pattern of stars around this object does not match the Andromeda constellation.  

Saturn has a magnitude of 0.4 which would produce the bright image here.  The points of light around the body in the center could be Saturnian moons.   The 3 stars to the right appear to be part of Sagittarius so I'm guessing this is an image of Saturn taken this past April. 

Since it was a 16 second exposure, I'm curious about the telescope and phone mount used here.  The Oppo A9 has some impressive cameras but this looks like it had some telescopic help.",1
Why would two different apps say the same exact thing.,1
"So you just started the hobby today and you're telling people who've been doing this for years that they're wrong?

Dude, have some humility. The photo you took is definitely not Andromeda and the people who replied explained why it can't be. You're wrong here, just accept it.",1
"Bruh, I’m from India, and as a fellow astronomer can assure you that light pollution in India is way worse than other countries due to air pollution. Just accept that thats Saturn , and don’t try to seek sympathy mentioning ur age.",1
"Sorry, but there is no way this is Andromeda. Don’t trust star tracker apps 100%",1
"It's saturn. Andromeda looks more like it does in this [link](http://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/b07.jpg). How long was your exposure time? Andromeda wouldn't show up like this at all in a phone. You'd have some brighter stars around it. This really does look like Saturn or, if you were actually looking in the direction of Andromeda, it was probably a bright star.",1
"Those apps rely on sensors in your phone to figure out exactly what direction you are pointing it, and they aren't always accurate.  Maybe not Saturn then, but possibly Jupiter or another very bright object.

It's awesome that you're out there photographing stuff, stick with it! Looking at the night sky is always time well spent!  Maybe ask your parents if there is an astronomy club in your area, there are usually super nice people there with awesome telescopes who would love to show a beginner some amazing views!",1
Why has this been upvoted so much? It's misidentified and an awful picture to begin with.,1
"That ist definitely not Andromeda. Andromeda isn’t that bright an if you did a long exposure of it there should be stars around it. Sorry, but I think it is fake.",1
That's some crumbs on your lens there my friend. Give it a wipe and Andromeda will probably be more visible.,1
This is a 10/10 troll post lol,1

"Yeah, that's straight up Saturn and Titan. Andromeda doesn't appear that bright.",1
"Hard to say from this pic, but that definitely doesn't look like andromeda.  Andromeda is actually very large in the night sky (6 times wider across than the full moon) but it's also extremely dim.  So if you took a photo of andromeda there would be many stars in the photo shining more brightly than the dim galaxy.  When I look at andromeda through my telescope it basically looks like a super faint smudge, much more faint than hundreds of stars that are also in view. I also can only make out the core of the Galaxy with my 8 inch reflector, mainly because of light pollution.

What you've photographed looks quite a bit brighter than the surrounding stars.  My guess is a planet like Saturn or Jupiter but hard to tell from this photo.",1

I told then that the entire work force in Astronomy was about the same size as one year's admittance to medical school (I think this was for the whole USA, but I don't remember)  Most jobs are at university or community college, and at university you will do research and also (likely) teaching.  Note also that some things we generally call ""astronomy"" are called something else at some universities, like ""planetary science"" or ""planetary geology"" (which is an oxymoron.)

2 - Plan backwards.  Look up people in what specialties you like, meaning, for example, if your thing is black holes, research the people who are responsible for the articles you have been reading about that subject.  Find out where they went to **graduate school**.   (Nearly all working astronomers have a PhD.)  You will find that they did not all go to schools you have heard about like CalTech or MIT.  Now, look up those graduate schools and figure out what their entrance requirements are.  What percentage of applicants do they take?  (And so on.)  Now, make note of this most important fact: **a lot of graduate schools do not take people from their own university**.  So if you find out that your ideal grad school is the University of Arizona, don't apply to the University of Arizona as an undergraduate.  Pick a place that will get you the background you need to get there as a graduate student.  Once you have some ideas about schools for your undergraduate degree, write to their admissions department and ask what they want in their ideal freshman.  That then becomes a goal of your **current plan**.   

3 - Very few high schools have astronomy as a subject.  The best you will likely get is physics.  Now I taught astronomy at a private high school - I know it can happen - but it is rare.  As I said above, your primary focus now should be math, as much as possible, and getting a high enough overall GPA and SAT reading score that it doesn't keep you out of the university you want.  Take the physics course if they have it, and do so as late as possible so you have as much math as you can get first.  You'll retake it in college unless you can get AP physics, but having that not be your first pass is always good.  

4 - This depends on what your interests are.  See if you can figure out what attracted you to astronomy?  Is there common ground in geology?  Physics itself?  (Most practical astronomy is physics applied to an astronomy problem.)   There are a lot of other jobs that use these skills, so getting the degree will not hurt you, but that's a decision that is well down the road.  Never give up on your dreams until you have to.  

Good luck.",1

"Not that you asked, but here is my ELI5.

The moon is technically in a full lunar eclipse when we have a blood moon. Usually, lunar eclipses describe when the earth is completely blocking the light from the sun, resulting in a completely black moon. However, when the moon's slightly inclined orbit is just right, a little bit of sunlight will ""peak"" from around the edges of earth's surface. This sunlight passes through a large portion of our atmosphere and gets scattered, as the guy said above. This essentially filters out all the blue snd green light from the sun and only red and yellow light makes it around the horizon of earth to reflect off of the moon's surface.",1
"I love this fact, and have often taken joy explaining this to people, but for some reason I never considered the distance and time between the Milky Way and Andromeda. It’s completely mind blowing!

"I would recommend getting a separate set of glasses. They are usually tuned for either near (like computer monitor) or far stuff. Depending on your actual vision, the difference might be quite noticeable. Also you can't get two pairs of glasses right: the optical properties are surely off (may have a health effects too). Or you can talk with your ophtalmologist about contact lenses, they make stargazing so much better.",1

"Astronomy is absolutely still a job today, although it's pretty different from the old days of peering through telescopes throughout the night. It's a highly competitive field, but a physics/astronomy degree sets you up to work in a wide range of different jobs.

1. Most astronomers work for universities.

2. There are hundreds of well respected universities around the world which do astronomy.

3. Most people haven't done any astronomy before University, just focus on physics and maths for now and apply when it comes to it.

"I'm afraid I don't know quite enough to comment on whether the eccentricity changes with time, but I do not see why not. Something big would have to tug on us to influence a change in our orbit though. The following article describes Jupiter as such an object, but our Moon helps stabilize us against those tugs. 

https://aasnova.org/2017/02/08/climate-of-an-earth-like-world-with-changing-eccentricity/ 

I do know that our Moon is receding from Earth at a rate of a few centimeters per year, thus sapping rotational energy from our planet and increasing the length of our day. This wouldn't effect eccentricity but figured you would be interested in this.

I will check out those apps! Honestly I might want to think about investing in a telescope down the road. Looking out into space gives me such a massive sense of comfort. Like nothing down here really matters all that much in the grand scheme of things - unless we decide that it does, which is ok, too, and often important (we do need to take care of each other down here) - it's just when I need things to NOT matter as much, all I have to do is look up and I'm reminded how absolutely insignificant my problems are in the context of all of space and time.",1

You should check out a live star map app like Stellarium or Sky Map. They show you the stars from your location in realtime and you can click on them to see their distance.

"Yes it is.  As is most everything else in the post.

The final count I heard was 42,000.

It will not ruin the ""amateur experience"".

It will not ""shut down professional surface astronomy""

As an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer, I have actually taken the time to research this.

Sure, it will create extra steps, the frames with streaks in them will have to discarded.

Worse case scenario,, we just have to take more frames.

But you have to weigh the benefits.

We are talking about high speed Internet everywhere in the world.

Right now we have over 5 million cell towers around the world.

We have fiber cables running through the oceans and across the world all causing a massive impact on our environment.

Without SpaceX satellites, we will need to drastically increase the number of cell towers and cables to make Internet accessible to the remaining 5 billion people that don't have it now, increasing drastically the environmental impact.

The SpaceX satellites will have zero effect on our environment and will provide Internet to 5 billion people that do not currently have Internet access.

This is an enormous benefit in exchange for discarding frames with streaks in them.

I use to feel the same way, that it would ruin the night sky, but then I did the research and found out - actually not really.  The average person won't even notice, and while thousands of astronomers will be inconvenienced, the benefits to the environment and billions of people is undeniable.",1

"**Parker Solar Probe**

Parker Solar Probe (previously Solar Probe, Solar Probe Plus, or Solar Probe+, abbreviated PSP) is a NASA robotic spacecraft launched in 2018, with the mission of repeatedly probing and making observations of the outer corona of the Sun. It will approach to within 9.86 solar radii (6.9 million kilometers or 4.3 million miles) from the center of the Sun and by 2025 will travel, at closest approach, as fast as 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph), or 0.064% the speed of light.The project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year. The cost of the project is US$1.5 billion. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory designed and built the spacecraft, which was launched on August 12, 2018.

"Here's what NASA had to say about it:  ""Sometimes the Sun's surface becomes a whirlwind of activity. Pictured is a time-lapse video of the Sun's surface taken over a two hour period in early May, run both forwards and backwards. The Sun's surface was blocked out so that details over the edge could be imaged in greater detail. Hot plasma is seen swirling over the solar limb in an ongoing battle between changing magnetic fields and constant gravity. The featured prominence rises about one Earth-diameter over the Sun's surface. Energetic events like this are becoming less common as the Sun nears a minimum in its 11-year activity cycle.""",1
"Not audibly but it will mess with radio waves so you can hear it as static fluctuations.

I think it may actually be bigger than the Earth.,1

Right on. Thanks for clarifying it. It’s amazing how big the sun is.,1
"NASA estimate about one Earth high, but based on experience with other images, I think it may be more.",1

To be pedantic it's not a tornado but a magnetic field line jutting out of the sun directing the plasma.,1
"Right, this is a Solar prominence.  Thanks, I appreciate the feedback.",1
"Going from what I recall from school, I believe this is form of Solar prominence, no? Due to the unusually complicated nature of the Sun's magnetic field, what we see is solar material caught in a tube of magnetism.

"None. Our sky is primarily blue because of rayleigh scattering, light that has shorter wavelengths gets scattered MUCH more compared to longer wavelength light. Even if our sun was a red dwarf the sky would still be blue (just much paler) or perhaps white.

It would require some sort of particulate that scatters green more than any other colour, if this were to occur than the planet is most likely not habitable.",1

"Not even The Rock, could save us from this thing, lol.",1
So you’re adding an extra 1/2 earth to NASA’s estimate just because you “think it’s more”?,1
This is gorgeous. Thanks for sharing!,1
"Aha! A great question.

So for this we're looking mostly at the models, we have some measurements over time from our orbiters and some limited measurements of extrasolar gas giants and generally they don't change a whole lot on the available timescales.

You would have tidal forces with the moons and internal tides causing the body of the gas to bulge in certain areas which would be more susceptible to wearing off in the solar wind. That is a mechanism that will gradually erode the mass of the gas giant.

A few things could add mass to the planet, like entry of asteroids and meteors into the gas giant body. Those things would most likely fall to the core and add to the total mass, but wouldn't occur very often unless something super disruptive happened to mix the existing contents of the solar system.

If things remain stable over the long term, the planet would eventually go one of two ways to die off before the parent star.

You could have the gas erode completely, potentially leaving behind a core if there's anything left after sublimation. That core would then experience its own aging and decay on its own timeline.

You could also have the planetary system be disrupted enough to send gas giants colliding and merging. With enough mass - probably more than is in our gas giants total - you would begin to see stellar ignition and a second star could form. Systems like this exist and have been imaged by Hubble and other similar projects.

The decay of these planets if left undisturbed is very slow, this is compared to the timeline of the star expanding and eating many of the inner planets. If the star goes as far as to expand and does not eat the gas giants, they will experience much more intense solar wind due to now being much closer - and the decay rate will also change. As will the tidal pull of the star on the gas, further accelerating decay of the atmosphere.

A planet with no atmosphere or leftover gas giant core can outlive its star by a lot if it's still far away, it's decay rate on its own is very very slow. The irradiation of a closer red giant surface would make the planet more radioactive overall, accelerating the nuclear decay rate of the rock materials. Rocky planets would need to be melted and boiled to decay before the star, which is possible if the surface of the star is close enough to the planet surface.

Given the relative sizes of our planets and star, it would seem we would need many more gas giants to light a second sun. And if we did, things in our solar system would rearrange in a chaotic period then slowly settle into a new organization.

Planets can outlive their stars, we may have gotten pluto and the other outermost planets from other systems! 

Great question!",1
It would require a gas that refracts in that color. Our sky is blue because of the refraction of the sun's light through the nitrogen in the atmosphere.,1

"Oh okay, thanks for correcting me because I need to know more about this but don't even know how the tools used by scientists and people who have the same type of equipment work.",1
"Your initial position was correct - the Earth doesn't trace a perfect circle around the Sun, nor is the tilt of our planet a stable 23.5°. 

First, each body in orbit around a thing has a measure called ""eccentricity,"" or how elliptical the orbital path of said body is. 

Most of the major bodies in the solar system trace a *near* perfect circle, but there is still a non-zero eccentricity. 

Here's a handy table: https://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm

The measure of eccentricity goes from 0-1. 0 being a perfect circle, 1 being a highly elliptical orbit. 

As for Earth's tilt, it is not perfect either. The pole will trace a circle over a long period of time (centuries). This means our North Star, Polaris, wasn't always our North Star. Nor will it be in the future. Essentially, the Earth has a bit of a wobble in its rotation.

https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6332

Hope this helps!

EDIT: I should also add that the eccentricity of Earth's orbit does NOT cause the seasons. The tilt of the Earth does. Tilting a hemisphere toward Sol will make the angle at which the rays strike the ground smaller, thus concentrating the heat energy over a smaller area (summer) than if it were tilted away (winter).",1
Well that's not true at all for wavelengths outside of our visible spectrum. Those are picked up by sensors sensitive to specific wavelengths then are assigned to wavelengths we can see.,1
"Absolutely not perfect. However, a interesting discussion is defining “perfect” in a reasonable context. Remember we are moving through space with the sun! You can’t return to the exact same point realistically, however if you define  a current location perhaps relative to the sun you can define returning to the same place. Obviously we can never truly know if we return to the “same place” perfectly because we don’t have perfect measurement. 

I would say that once you have a certain location p defined properly, saying that a completed orbit around the sun resulting in you being within some fixed distance around p, we could settle at some definition of “virtually perfect”- where we come back to a small neighborhood of the point every year.",1
Did you make a wish?,1

Legendary dude.,1
"Aw, I’m in east Hampshire and missed it",1
When the sun runs out of hydrogen in its core it will be to expand significant however it does not increase in mass. That means material at the other edge of the expansion envelope will feel the gravity of the star less as it continues to get further away. Sort of like humans going into space will eventually be able to float because they are no longer experiencing enough of earths gravity to plant them solidly to their spacecraft. Eventually the outer edges of sun material will escape the gravity of the sun and float off into space. This is why the red giant phase is associated with mass losses of 10^10 times greater than compared to the sun on the normal main sequence. Eventually this mass leaves the entire solar systems and thus the planets will not feel the same mass as the original sun and their orbits will decay.,1

"Dark energy is pushing everything apart, so no, the back holes won't merge.  They will get farther and farther away from each other, and will evaporate separately. 

Once all matter has evaporated into energy, one starts to ask the question of whether it makes sense to talk about the universe anymore.  Time won't matter since there will be nothing left that is affected by time. 

Essentially the heat death of the universe is just that: the death of the universe.  Nothing else happens after that.  In fact, the concept of ""after"" no longer really exists.",1
"Because space is expanding and filling up with dark energy ,could that weaken space to the point where all the black holes merge before they evaporate . Or do they evaporate separately .Or do they merge and pull in what's left of space then implode then evaporate. And what happens to all the dark energy and matter once everything else has evaporated,does that evaporate to.",1
"Yes, eventually there will be nothing left in the universe except for black holes, and eventually they will evaporate as well.",1
"I don't usually read them, but I remember one that claimed to simultaneously reinvent physics and economics through the same theory. It rambled on and on, but about half way through, he said that he came up with the idea while he was high on acid in the desert.",1
"Thanks for your type-up, you seem knowledgeable and I'm in line at store so can't look up myself.  I would assume that as the sun expands the mass would stay the same, thus the gravitational effect on orbits would as well.  This would also lower the orbital velocity relationship with the distance to the sun's surface.  Am I assuming wrong?",1
Haha...yeah look close and you might spot a Thargoid Basilisk. 😉,1
Haha yeah i know.,1
Most constellations are hard to make out i guess. Asterisms like the Pleiades are easier to spot. Most can find the Big Dipper for example or the “hour glass” in Orion for example. Must harder to make out all og Ursa Major or all of Orion. At least thats my guess.,1

"Not to burst your bubble, but if you are asking this question, you do not have a theory, nor do you have a real hypothesis. 

I am an astro undergrad at a major research university. So when I exchanged my ideas (that is really all they are. And, I could not call it a theory since there is no testing), the world-renowned physicist I shared them with was like, ""Oh ya, we are working on that already, but it isn't very promising."" Or, ""that was an idea about 20 years ago."" Apparently, they get a lot of ideas from people all of the time. 

I am a junior, I know a little physics, but at this point, I could never develop a real hypothesis, let alone write it up mathematically. I just don't have the skills yet. After I completed Calc 3, I thought, ""wow, I know a lot of math."" Then this quarter I took my first upper-division math class and it was like, ""great, now that you know your ABC's, let's learn to spell, then we will learn math.""

But, if you are absolutely sure you have a real idea, go visit your closest physics department and see if you can get a meeting with a physicist. My university always has astro and cosmo colloquiums, and I believe they are open to the public. 

Also, I think there is a way to upload to Arxiv, but even if you do, it will never be taken seriously if you are not affiliated with a university, let alone without real math.",1
"Never thought of that.

But since the the atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen and Helium, that would mean the speed of sound would be \~1100m/s so they wouldn't beak any sound barrier with \~600m/s.

But if the wind speed was \~1100m/s I think it wouldn't break the sound barrier either as I suspect the speed of sound would act as a sort of speed limit.",1

Yeah sorry. Will edit.,1

Nice photo. Great job.,1
"“Star flares?”

Do you mean the diffraction spikes?",1
"First off as you've identified, we know very little for sure. This is mostly because we aren't able to directly measure most things about these planets like their inner composition and core size and density etc. But there's still quite a bit we can do, because the development is still constrained by familiar physics in the same universe, same star system no less. With that plus the measurements we have taken by sending robotic probes out into space, we can use models to do some informed guesswork. 

A few things that we do know from probes and pictures: our gas giant planets spin, and sometimes on unusual axes or very quickly compared to our planet and sun; the top layers of some planets rotate in bands with widely different rotational speeds; these planets have orbiting moons that can be made of gas ices or rocky materials - one of which shoots out water geisers into space periodically; these planets have familiar gasses in their visible top layers we can identify using spectroscopy; these planets have magnetic fields that also interact with solar wind - meaning that they develop partly by action of the sun's rays and particles; these planets tend to have relatively very thin and flat gas ice rings extending far out into space (they aren't exactly flat - robotic probe) and some more stuff

So, we can add some of bernoullis principle and gravitational models of free gaseous particles in open space, factor in the solar wind and presence of other materials needed to form the other planets, and place it in the space of our own galaxy rewound some four and a half billion years and you get approximately this for a timeline of gaseous planet development:

Free particles in space, grouping at solar system scale due to mostly gravitational forces at work between adjacent particles causing clumps of ever larger scale until other forces take over. Mainly informed by closest stars reasonably far away - minute forces overall allowing microgravity to dictate movement. Made of hydrogen and helium and a small amount of denser stuff from nearby supernovas

Local macrogravitational forces take over from microgravity and the big clump defining the middle of the solar system begins collapsing into a star as gravitational forces approach then meet then exceed nuclear forces keeping atoms separate in the centers of clumps.

Fusion occurs at first chaotically as smaller pockets reach fusion conditions before their surroundings. Solar wind begins slowly and chaotically, mixing the surrounding soup of particles. 

Gradually the particles continue to unite as initiating and newly fusing clumps, slowly forming the big clump that will become our star. Some fusion reactions spark others, or blow them out. It's messy for a while as things get going, the heat agitates the particles and causes more activity overall in the forming system. 

Meanwhile in the surroundings the particle soup continues to swirl about into its own clumps, gradually settling into protoplanet-building rocks and gas pockets. The magnetic fields of the source particles are being informed by the solar wind and galactic forces. Materials settle in the solar wind as if in a liquid, denser to the bottom and lighter to the top - with some kicked to the top such as in boiling water. 

Even up to this point new alien particles can enter the outer regions of the space freely, there is still only microgravity ruling except in the center.

Once the protostar is fully lit, its gravity begins to recede as its temperature and fusion rate increase. It's full of dust still alongside the fusion materials so it's dirty and not fully powerful yet. It ejects this dust in intense solar winds, providing even more heat and charge and mixing force to the surroundings.

The proto planets are forming at this point, clumps of gas mix when they meet in the chaotic soup, and when rocky clumps collide they heat up and may partly melt together in explosive contact. If one is much bigger than the other it may consume the smaller. The direction and speed of the impacts alter the rotation direction and speed of the growing planet.

The star gets cleaner and more fusion occurs, pumping still more pressure into the surroundings. The ejected material rains down on the forming planets and out into distant space

The body of space around the star is chaotic and still itself in mostly free space, giving the overall body the ability to rotate freely on its own axis. Due to natural variations in the mix, an average bulk rotation develops that also dictates the outgoing pressure of solar wind, causing the star to rotate alongside the surrounding bulk.  Rotations continue to develop at the planet and moon scale, inside of the bulk rotation. Gravity begins constraining the plane of rotation. 

The rocky proto planets are now large enough to collapse surrounding meteors, causing intense growth and heating and accelerated rotation. The quickly growing gravity of these planets begins to affect further and further objects. We suspect that one was a nearby proto planet that was drawn to the molten early Earth to collide and expel the molten blob that would become our moon.

From there as the surface cooled it ceased boiling and expelling liquids and gasses from the particle soup, and they collect on the planet surface. They provide tidal forces that gradually pushed the moon away to the distance we now see.

The gas planets would collect the same particle soup as the rocky planets, just according to what particles were local to the formation of the planets. The solar wind would push more gasses out than rocks, so the gas giants likely formed where the gasses naturally settled between solar wind outward pressure and gravity inward pressure. They could have rocky centers inclusive of both familiar rocks and solid gasses. The moons could be clumped asteroids that entered the gravity of the growing planet, eventually getting big enough to collapse the bulk into a few larger bodies.

From there, the planets continued to collect gasses gradually clearing out the empty space of the solar system in cooperation with the solar wind. Their rotation likely informed by how the clumps all joined together, from what direction and speed etc.

As they age they develop the magnetic fields of the composing materials, interact tidally with their moons and more distant objects like the asteroid belt, and deflect/mix with the solar wind. Being partly in the shadow of the solar wind from a more inward planet would very very slightly change the acceleration pressure from the shaded side of the planet via bernoillis principle, partly informing the rotations of the planets behind solar gravity and local forces. 

Within the gas giants we would expect precipitation and clouds and other familiar gaseous movement, because they are the same gasses as we have just much more and in a different mix. You might be able to float an airship for instance, if you adjusted for the density of the gas and the movement. You might see solid gas precipitation near the core, from gravity compressing already dense gasses. If you could add enough mass to a planet like that, you may turn it into a protostar - given the right combination and types of gasses and a lot of material.

"The fate of a planet or planets in a star system are usually tied to the fate of their host stars. For example, in roughly three billion years our sun will evolve to the next stage of its lifecycle and become a red giant. This phase will increase the radius of the sun to extreme sizes (it will potential consume the orbit of the earth). In this case the planets will likely be destroyed when colliding with the hot gas from the sun).  However some planets can survive this phase but eventually much of the mass from the sun will leave the system in the form of winds and all that will remain is a white dwarf. If any planets survive this dynamic transition without being gravitationally flung from the system then they could potentially orbit the white dwarf and continue to survive. However, the white dwarf will not be putting out nearly as much light and thus the planets will become very cold.

 In the case of systems with stars much more massive than our sun, the planets will likely be destroyed in the supernova explosion at the end of that stars life or the resulting black hole.

"If you’ve never seen one, get out there next time you have a chance.  The “Blood Moon” is surreal.  For now, you can settle for this.  

If you are curious about this sort of thing, you are welcome to find me over on Instagram [@thevastreaches](https://www.instagram.com/thevastreaches/) and follow along.

If you’d like to nerd out for a moment, here is an explanation of what you are seeing...

This sequence begins as the moon is deep within the Earth’s shadow.   At this point, the ruddy “blood moon” is very dimly lit by sunlight refracted (bent) through Earth’s atmosphere.    I snapped a frame every 10 seconds.  Notice how the movement of the moon is apparent relative to the background stars!   

As the Moon escapes Earth’s umbral shadow, the scene is flooded with reflected sunlight.   The moon quickly transitions from a crescent phase, back to full.   The edge of this shadow allows us to observe the curvature of the Earth. 

From the rear camera, you can see the action of the tracking mount turning opposite the Earth’s rotation.   You may even notice my arm reaching in to adjust the exposure on the fly ... trying to keep the scene properly exposed.   The clouds flying through made consistency a rather futile effort.

Both were shot on DSLR cameras and lenses, no telescopes were harmed in the making of this video.   The eclipse is from Sept 27, 2015.  One of the cool things about astrophotography is you can always revisit your earlier work when you learn new tricks.  

Enjoy for now, because the world won’t see its next total lunar eclipse for another year and a half!",1
Do you have a Astronomy related theory that you want to publish.,1
"On large timescales, yes.  Everything eventually undergoes proton decay, which essentially means that the planet will slowly evaporate into energy, assuming it goes through its whole life without colliding with a black hole.",1

"On the other hand, we could say that the planet is ""dead"" when it's volcanism stops at 100%. But the planet will remain at it's place if there is no disruptive element. But if a dead planet means that it is no more, it have to be destructed by a star, a big celestial body....",1

Brocchi's Cluster (also known as Collinder 399, Cr 399 or Al Sufi's Cluster) is a random grouping of stars located in the constellation Vulpecula near the border with Sagitta. The members of the star cluster form an asterism which has given rise to its name as the Coathanger.

**True color [(static image)](https://i.imgur.com/y0XejJw.jpg)**

When imaging deep space objects, we tend to put filters in front of our cameras to only let in a very specific wavelength of light. When we are looking to create a true color image, those filters are red, green, and blue (R, G, B). We take these hours of data captured over many nights to create a single final image. With this, we can then color calibrate the image. You might be wondering how we do this, since with many normal photographs, we can just color calibrate by eye. There are many databases out there with thousands and thousands of star values for color, we actually use these to color calibrate our image. After completing color calibration, the final step is to stretch the image. In very simple terms, this simply means to brighten the image. After stretching, I did not do any further adjustments to keep it as minimally edited as possible. What makes it nearly entirely red though? That is the emission of hydrogen. With hydrogen being the most abundant element in the nebulae, and most nebulae, almost all of them appear to be red. 

So now you might be asking yourself, if this is true color, would it be what I see if I were just in a spaceship floating in space? The answer is no. That is simply because our eyes are not bright enough to see the color on many of these objects. For example, if you go into your room wearing a red shirt and turn all the lights off, what color is your shirt you can no longer see? Is it black, or is it red? Clearly your shirt is still red, it is just too dark for you to see. But you might be thinking if you were closer, it would be brighter, right? Not really. As you get closer to these objects, they get larger, which offsets the brightness gains. The way I like to think of this is with the Milky Way. We are *in* the Milky Way, we physically can't get closer to it, yet it still looks nothing like images of it. 

**False color [(static image)](https://i.imgur.com/1SAK3sR.jpg)** 

Similar to the true color image, are false color image uses filters that are made to look at specific wavelengths. However, in this case we are looking for specific wavelengths based on excitation of different elements (Sulfur II, Hydrogen α, and Oxygen III). These elements all have very precise emission wavelengths, so we can use filters to only let their light through and block unwanted source such as light pollution or moonlight. [Here](https://starizona.com/acb/ccd/advimages/Narrowband%20Diagram.jpg) is a chart that shows where they each lie in the visible spectrum. With this in mind, we assign Sii to red, Hα to green, and Oiii to blue. Since hydrogen is by far the most dominant gas, we then remove the green from the image. This leaves us with areas where the green and red have mixed (gold), and green and blue (cyan). Not only do many find this to be a relatively pleasing color, but it also allows us to see areas with high sulfur content, and areas with higher oxygen content rather than a giant mass of hydrogen. Whenever you see images of nebulae that are colors other than nearly all red, it is most likely a false colored image. 

**TL;DR** - True color images use RGB filters and are color calibrated using stars, false color images show us compositional differences throughout the nebulae. Both are real images entirely in the visible spectrum

"The visible colours are due to a balance between the plasma from the meteoroid and and the plasma from the surrounding air. Which dominates will depend on how fast the meteor is moving. Red is from atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen, iron gives yellow and nickel gives green.

"Ok, first of all, im gonna ask you something; Does Iron Man look obviously fake in the movies?  Its not hard to fake things in this day and age.  If i wanted to i could create an identical effect in Windows movie maker in an hours tops.  

Secondly, think *critically* for a moment.  Why in gods name would CNN place a subliminal message in the middle of a new broadcast for some unspecified celestial event?  Why would they say ""alert"", but then also attempt to hide the message?  An exact time of the event was given, a time that has great significance in our calendar but has absolutely no significance in the grand scheme of things, so one can assume that the warning isn't for a natural event like Betelgeuse going Supernova as some people have suggested.  Thus we must ask, what UNnatural event might it be?  Aliens?  Time Travellers?  God himself?  

Why the *fuck* would CNN be in direct contact with aliens, time travellers, and/or god?  If these speculative beings placed the message there themselves, why hasn't CNN made a statement about it?  If this really did get broadcasted live, then why isn't EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD making a statement about it?  Why isn't everyone in the world talking about a major american news broadcaster broadcasting a subliminal message, implying fore-knowledge of a major, unnatural celestial event, possibly implying the existence of time travel, aliens, or gods?  Like, that wouldn't just be the news of the year or the decade, that would be the news of *our fuckin' existence as a species*.

*****
&gt; The two supermassive black holes are orbiting each other, and at the same time, each is exerting its own pull on the stars around it.

&gt; The gravitational forces from the black holes pull on these stars and make them change their orbit; in other words, after one revolution around the supermassive black hole pair, a star will not go exactly back to the point at which it began.

&gt; Using a well-studied star, called S0-2, which orbits the supermassive black hole that lies at the center of the galaxy every 16 years, we can already rule out the idea that there is a second supermassive black hole with mass above 100,000 times the mass of the Sun and farther than about 200 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth.

"Calendars wont exist, since such accuracy should require the publisher to know an except location but an app that actually calculates these might, though I don't know of any.",1

"I think you're conflating a few things.  First, the 1370 C temperature is listed as the max temp the sun shade is designed to withstand.  This doesn't necessarily mean it *is* getting that hot.  And the sun shade isn't the object being cooled by the cooling system.  Rather, the cooling system is for the solar panels, which according to wiki are only used outside 0.25 AU and are retracted behind the sun shade for the closest part of the approach.  So those aren't getting anywhere near that 1370 C temperature.

All that said, I suspect cooling on Venus would serve an even greater challenge.  The PSP at least has a hot side and cold side, which allows the radiators to function effectively; a Venus lander would be hot everywhere, in addition to the corrosive elements and extreme pressure.",1
It dont look fake 🤷🏻‍♂️,1
"Like, the co-ordinates aside, i find it absolutely shocking that people think this is real.",1

Now it could have been an edited video and not really shot live.",1
"Probably won't find one since it varies by elevation, topography, atmospheric distortion, and other factors that make it impractical to narrow it down to the second.",1
"Ok, so as a few people have pointed out so far, ""RA"" and ""DEC"" refer to ""Right Ascension"" and ""Declination"", which denote that these are definitely night-sky co-ordinates.  There are websites that can be used to view areas of the sky using celestial co-ordinates (i used  [https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl) ) in a large array of different wavelengths, which i saw was a concern of yours in a previous comment.  

Basically, theres nothing there.  There are stars, but not clusters or anything.  Theres dust in the IR field images, but no Nebulas or anything interesting like that.  There isn't even, like, a single significant star in any of the images.  The one thing that i'd say is unusual is that in the H-Alpha filter image (to clarify, H-Alpha is basically just a very specific wavelength of red light, so anything that appears in an H-Alpha image should also appear in a wider ""Red"" image) has an odd sort of blotch on it, but given that this blotch also doesn't appear in any wide-band red filter image i am gonna ASSUME its an error.  Another piece of evidence for this being an error is that H-Alpha light is generally associated with star formation and incredibly bright, young stars, and there is zero evidence of this in any other image.  

In some of the Gamma images show three clear stars right in the middle of the frame and nothing else, which is a fact that some other people have picked up on, but the fact of the matter is that those Gamma images are only resolved properly right in the middle of the frame, so to only see something in the middle of the frame isn't only not surprising, but its down-right expected.  It would be stranger to see a star off to the side in one of these images, but then it would probably be another error in the capture.  

In conclusion, your previous statement that "" You are missing what our eyes are unable to see unassisted. "", nowadays, is false.  We have the technology to see virtually every wavelength of light, from the highest energy light to radiowaves with wavelengths miles long, so if there was ANYTHING in that part of the sky that was out of the ordinary then we would know.  

I also would feel remiss if i didn't point out that no, Black Holes have never been created in a lab.  When the LHC was first activated there was an *idea* that it *might* be able to create incredibly small, short-lived Black Holes, but since then we now know for sure that it can't and it doesn't.  Also Black Holes and Worm Holes are related in the sense that they're to do with general relativity, but thats about it.  To create either one is a very different prospect; to create a Black Hole you'd just need to create a point of sufficiently dense energy such that it collapses in on itself, and then you're done.  To create a Worm Hole you'd need to keep pouring masses on energy into the system to keep it stable enough to use, which would be a hell of a lot harder.  

And then i feel i should cap this off by saying that the video is obviously not real.  Are you trying to tell me that if a serious big news broadcaster attempted to insert a subliminal message into a show it WOULDN'T instantly get jumped on by every man, woman and child in the WORLD?",1

That has nothing to do with whether something is fake or not. But as I said above, doubt should be the default position. You don't believe everything you hear until you get evidence otherwise, it's the other way around. You should disbelieve something until such time that evidence demonstrates that it is correct.

"**Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird**

The Lockheed SR-71 ""Blackbird"" is a long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft that was operated by the United States Air Force. It was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s by Lockheed and its Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson was responsible for many of the design's innovative concepts. During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats.

**Hafele–Keating experiment**

The Hafele–Keating experiment was a test of the theory of relativity. In October 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer, took four cesium-beam atomic clocks aboard commercial airliners. They flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks against others that remained at the United States Naval Observatory. When reunited, the three sets of clocks were found to disagree with one another, and their differences were consistent with the predictions of special and general relativity.

***

**Proper time**

In relativity, proper time along a timelike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following that line. It is thus independent of coordinates, and is a Lorentz scalar. The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time. This interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line.

"""Paradox"" is a bad name. Think of it more like a common mistake that leads to nonsense results. The nonsense results are paradoxical, hence the name, but that shows that there's a mistake in your math somewhere, not that there's an inherent paradox in the universe.

So, to explain the paradox:

One key principle of relativity is that there is no absolute reference frame. If I'm on a train, I could think of myself as stationary and the world moving behind me, or I could think of the world as stationary and my train moving forward, and the physics should work out exactly the same either way. 

Special relativity is often (over)simplified to say that ""moving objects experience time slower than stationary objects. If I place an extremely precise clock on the [SR-71](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird) and have it do a lap, it will come back reading slightly less time has passed than a clock on earth. (Incidentally, this experiment [has been done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment).)

In the twin paradox, we send one twin to a distant planet and back at near-light speed while the other stays on earth. The twin on earth says 

&gt;""I'm stationary, my sister is moving. Moving observers experience time more slowly, so when my twin comes back, she'll have experienced less time and so be younger.""

But, since there's no absolute stationary reference frame, the twin in the spaceship might just as easily say 

&gt;""I'll set this spaceship as my reference frame. From my point of view, it looks like earth is moving away from me, and then coming back. Since I'm stationary and my brother on earth is moving, he'll have moved and I'll be stationary, so he'll have experienced less time and be younger.""

Obviously, both twins can't be younger than the other, hence the paradox.

The resolution comes from clarifying the second principle from earlier. I don't know a non-technical way to explain it (See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time) wiki article), but essentially it states that while there might not be absolute velocity, there *is* absolute acceleration. The principle that ""moving objects experience time slower"" does not necessarily apply to objects that accelerate or change direction. 

So, the paradox is an error that comes from applying an oversimplification to a situation where it doesn't apply. Nothing more than that.

I hope that helps and is at least a little comprehensible.",1
"Neil deGrasse Tyson explains it’s in easy terms on a short video series called Inexplicable Universe. 

The closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time “passes” compared to someone traveling as a slower speed (eg: someone on Earth). 

So if you take two twins, one traveling at Earth speed through space-time and one traveling at 90% of the speed of light, the one on Earth will age normally (to us, on Earth) and the one won’t age as much bc time will have passed more slowly for them. 

Trying to think of an easier way, but imagine you have two rubber bands. One is held without any stretching (space-time on Earth), one is pulled as to 90% stretch (90% speed of light).

If you put a mark at 2in on both bands, when you let go, the one that wasn’t stretched will show the mark at 2in (or close enough), the one that was stretched will show the mark at 0.2in or whatever (math isn’t on my side right now).",1

"The [semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes) is a component of the ellipse formula and goes hand in hand with the eccentricity to determine the parameters of the ellipse. It is a basic orbital component.

"This (and pictures and people like this) is the reason I look up to the sky during full moon and can't stop laughing, can't stop wondering how we managed to get up there, how we can go beyond, and still drag anchors the size of our egos that keep us grounded. Stunning picture.",1
What was the quality of the sky (bortle scale)?,1
This is gorgeous.,1
"I've always found it weird that because it's much easier to measure low-degree oscillations of stars than higher-degrees, that means you can actually learn more about their core rotation than their near-surface rotation.",1

"Beautiful pic! We don't really understand this galaxy that well. Why is the structure so messy? Why do our theoretical models say it should form a bar when it clearly doesn't? What role did interactions (as OP said) really play in its evolution? I tried simulating it, was hard work but got kinda close: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVSBpbFTh3s&amp;. All that doesn't distract from its awesomeness though!",1
"OP this is so cool thank you for sharing!

Also, I love that it looks like there’s a little smiley face at the top middle of the picture.",1
"There are about 6,000 or so stars that are visible with the naked eye, and the vast majority of them are within about 1,000 light-years of the Sun. Stars dim quickly with distance; from even 60 light-years away, the Sun would fade to invisibility. Only the most luminous of stars can be seen from greater distance, stars like Deneb (probably 1,500–2,500 light-years away), Eta Carinae (7,500 light-years), and Rho Cassiopeiae (8,000–12,000 light-years). About a couple of dozen in total make that list.

So when you look up at the night you are seeing even the most distant stars in the sky as they were less than 10 millennia ago. Most are closer.

But stars live much, much longer than that. The Sun will continue on as it is now for many billions of years. Even the most luminous stars, which use up their core fuel far more quickly, can live for 1 million years or more. That means the odds of a star happening to die while its light is already on its way to Earth are very small; in terms of the star’s lifetime, a few thousand years is the blink of an eye. A star would have to be very, very near its own death for this to happen after a very, very long life.

I can think of very few exceptions, though Eta Carinae fits the bill. It’s on the edge of exploding; in the 1840s it underwent a massive paroxysm that was just short of a supernova event. It may not go off for another 50,000 years, but it might tonight.

Excellent!  I spent 2 years trying to spot this one with my XT 4.5.  I finally found a little galaxy-shaped patch of sky that was less dark than the rest of the background.  Sure enough it was with binoculars as you said.  Great photo.,1

"His work on the dynamics of the Milky Way was probably his greatest achievement, he placed observations in a model which showed the Milky Way was a rotating disk. He was also one of the first astronomers to recognise the potential of radio astronomy, and was among the first to detect the hydrogen 21 cm line and start mapping the Milky Way. One of his collaborators, van de Hulst, built upon this work to measure the rotation of the Andromeda galaxy. This result was the start of an upheaval that lead to the rise of dark matter. Oort had considered dark matter long before in fact, and was among the earliest pioneers. He was also one of the fathers of the European Southern Observatory, which is now leading the world in ground based astronomy.",1
I was wondering when you would chime in! Thanks!,1
Astronomer here!  Nearly every distinguishable dot in this image is a foreground star.,1
There was a recent paper about galaxies losing their dark matter to another galaxy during collision.  I can't recall if the data was empirical or from simulations.,1
It's amazing to me that this exists. That we're just in the midst of all this stuff. It's mindblowing,1
"Yep!  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve#/media/File:Rotation_curve_of_spiral_galaxy_Messier_33_\(Triangulum\).png) is a plot showing this effect, showing what is expected versus reality.  This is the key reason people realized dark matter exists (since then, we have realized it also is needed to explain things like the large scale structure of the universe).",1

"I humbly present my second image of a deep space object, Triangulum. Spiral galaxy M33 is located in the triangle-shaped constellation Triangulum, hence its name. About half the size of our Milky Way galaxy, M33 is the third-largest member of our Local Group of galaxies following the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way.

The Triangulum galaxy’s orderly spiral structure displays few signs of interactions with nearby galaxies. However, that could change in the future. Only slightly farther away from us than the Andromeda galaxy, about 3 million light-years from Earth, M33 is a suspected gravitational companion to Andromeda, and both galaxies are moving toward our own. M33 could become a third party involved in the impending collision between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies more than 4 billion years from now.

M33 has a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 5.7, making it one of the most distant objects that keen-eyed observers can view with the unaided eye (under exceptionally clear and dark skies). Although a telescope will start to reveal some of M33’s spiral features, the diffuse galaxy is actually easiest to examine with low magnification and a wide field of view, such as through binoculars. It is best observed in October.

Although others may have viewed the galaxy earlier, Charles Messier was the first to catalog M33 after observing it in August 1764. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble studied dozens of variable stars (those that periodically change brightness) in M33, which helped him to estimate the object’s distance and prove that M33 is not a nebula within our own galaxy, as previously suspected, but actually a separate galaxy outside our own.

It's so difficult to truelly comprehend the scale of these cosmic structures.,1
Username checks out,1
If it's on Facebook it must be true.,1
"Yeah, the nearest nebula is the Helix nebula (700 light years, or 214 parsecs).

From a very simple calculation (1/214) the parallax would only be 0.00467 arcseconds...

We don't even have instruments capable of accurately detecting that small of a change.",1
See my comment above,1
"Right, I guess we’re talking a couple of hundred light years to the nearest nebulae.  The Earths solar orbit is going to be pretty tiny compared to that.",1
"They aren't bright at all, except for a few exceptions like the Orion Nebula which you can see with your eyes.",1
It was written on the facebook page where I found the image,1
These are 3D renders. The largest parallax effect you can get is under 1 arcsecond in difference.,1
"You couldn't be more wrong my friend, why would you say that?

This is one of the CG works of the very talented nebula master: [https://www.artstation.com/teunvanderzalm](https://www.artstation.com/teunvanderzalm)",1
It reminds so much of Wall-e's opening sequence,1
"Not real, 3D renders. The amount parallax effect you get from distant objects is way smaller than 1 arcseconds (1/3600 of a degree).",1
Yeah you could do this to any photo on the HTC One M8 like 3 phones ago!,1
"I wonder, how can nebulas look so bright? Aren't they like, very big?",1
"That.. is not true.  The distance we move around the sun in a single year is nowhere near enough to move anywhere close to a single degree relative to the closest nebula.  It would take millennia to get that much of a change in perspective.  

If anything, these 3D models made from an *interpretation* of a few flat images and then the *model* is rotated.  It can't even be a series of animated real images because every image of a nebula released by NASA is already in false color.",1
Like a grey-ish blob with some very faint color. The visible light spectrum is very small and the nebulae are so far away so hubble telescope needs ultraviolet and infrared sensors to highlight galaxies and dust clouds properly,1
stars torn asunder by the forces giving birth to the atoms from which we are made,1
"So, are we talking real images but rendered to add a 3D effect?  Or is the 3D effect a result of Earth parallax or some such?",1
Then how will it look?,1
Sadly not. The photos amateur astronomers and hubble take are done with color filters,1
Would it really look like this if I was floating in space?,1
That's both mesmerising and terrifying at the same time! Congrats!,1
That's really great,1
animating real captured images,1
"Is this animation, or timelapses of real nebula movements?",1
Looks like a phoenix!,1
"&gt; like on earth heat is transferred from a particle to another

That is conduction, radiation is the transfer of heat via electromagnetic radiation and requires no medium.",1
"Yeah, I read the article. None of them stand out as anything unique to intelligent life. Thanks to the inverse square law and the astronomical distances involved, a radio source from an intelligent species is going to fade into the background noise pretty quickly.

Couple that with the speed of light, and we have an even greater problem. Humans have been making radio transmissions for about a century, meaning our earliest transmissions are reaching, at most, 100 light years. If there's an alien species with their own SETI project, this means they'd have to be within 100 light years of us to even detect our transmission. By corollary, we'd have to be close enough to detect their signals in the span of time they've been making them.

If we're just looking for *any* intelligent signal, from any point in time, well, that just means a much greater likelihood that such a signal is a) getting swamped out by interfering sources of RF energy, or b) is so far away that the inverse square law works its magic. This is, of course, assuming an alien race would be using RF to communicate in the first place. If they've evolved anything like us, it's likely they learned how to transmit RF with smaller and smaller intensities. For example, a satellite phone operates with a maximum of 400 milliwatts...roughtly around that of a consumer Wi-Fi router.",1
"Not to mention 70% fall over the sea, no one sees those.",1
"When does a meteor cross into being a bolide? In burning up, don't they all kind of explode?",1
"The Geminids are coming up this weekend, so good chance to catch some more!",1
"What was good about the Chelnyabinsk event was that due to most drivers having dash cams (and it being daytime so lots of people about) the trajectory could be accurately determined so they knew exactly where to look for any part that managed to get to the ground.

Plus the ones where it exploded mid-air followed by windows being shattered made it easy to calculate at what height it happened.",1
"From orange to green? That’s weird... Cause the colour is due to the composition and it should be the same all over. Maybe the inside is copper rich and outside is the orange stuff? Idk, I’m not a professional astronomer yet.",1
Perfectly legit question. The radiation emitted by a warm body (e.g. infrared) would certainly be felt by your skin absorbing it. If you put your bare hand out in a vacuum 1cm from a white hot iron bar ... you'd notice it!,1
"Once i went out in my garden to cary the chairs inside. And when i stood there i could see a bright light like a flare. following the shadows i could make out that it had to come from behind me and than i saw this bright fast light. This Meteor split into two mid air one kept on the other slowed down. I was so stuned that i ran in woke u my GF and told it to her like a little boy happy about his new toy and than we heard a far away bang.

the thought that this stone/block of ice was out there for thousands if not millions of years just to end on earth and be observed by me is just mindblowing for me",1
"I mean the majority are really small, I got a good feel for it in the Atacama desert - camping in the desert - one of clearest sky on the planet. Gazing at the milky way you can see lots of faint wisps of tiny meteors, like 1-10 a minute outside of meter season.",1
Thanks! This was captured with my WO GT81 and ZWO 1600mm. I’ve added a lot more details in my post in [r/astrophotography](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/e93ub5/the_horsehead_and_flame_in_hydrogen_alpha/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you want to check it out 🙂,1
"I've seen quite a few, including the [Sutter's Mill meteorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutter%27s_Mill_meteorite?wprov=sfla1), most of which I can attribute to driving a convertible, as they were above my windshield frame when I saw them, ha.",1
Between 18k and 86k are estimated to fall to earth every year. Not all are this big ofc.,1
We need more meteors then to fight global warming :D,1
"I had to check, but a 15% increase in detection radius does indeed increase the volume of space covered by about 50%.",1
What’s your setup? This is incredible,1
Maybe? I don’t remember that one.,1
"One of the most recognizable icons of the night sky, I captured this image of the Horsehead over a couple of nights leading up to the full moon. This is the result of 157 photos totaling 7 hours and 51 minutes in Hydrogen Alpha which blocks all but a very small band-pass of light from getting through. Great for when the moon is out!

My Instagram in case  you would like to see more of my photos: [https://www.instagram.com/mos\_astro/](https://www.instagram.com/mos_astro/)",1
"No, there are thousands... You've never seen footage from the 2013 meteor in Russia?!",1
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=meteor+video,1
What confuses you about my question?,1
What kind of question is that...,1
I was wondering how you watch a meteor strike a cricket and somehow lose it,1
So this is what IdrA is up to nowadays,1
"Nice, where will those results be posted ?",1
Good stuff. That’s real good stuff right there.,1
"This is a simple differentiation between how heat is transferred. Light or photons can move through a vacuum so you can feel the heat being transferred through the photons (think the sun heating the earth) but you cannot feel heat in a vacuum in the traditional sense of when something really hot in front of you it heats up air molecules around it and those hot air particles reach your skin which is called conduction. There are 3 different types of heat transfer: conduction, radiation, and convection if you want to learn more.",1
Ha!! So true.,1
"Yep they are cold, only a very small layer of the meteorite becomes fusion crust and approximately 80% of it that does become fusion crust is ablated off. The meteorite had been frozen in space for literally billions of years and is frozen completely through. The few seconds it's heated from the atmosphere is only enough energy to heat the very outside. By the time it cools and falls to the ground it the outside has again been cooled by the frozen inside. Infact stories of people feeling heat when they pick up a fresh fall is usually extreme cold that is being mistaken for heat. 

I study meteorites and asteroids as a master's student of planetary geology.",1
Is this the worlds first vivid and high def video documentation of a meteor cutting through the atmosphere?,1
"WTF! I know that meteors do crash into Earth all the time and in fact I have a collection of meteorites, but that still so surreal",1
for sure heavy,1
Aw did Steven Spielburg film this?,1
"Nah, Aliens. This is all a cover up.",1
I've have a look at M38 through 6 inch newt recently but had no idea it shared the same area with such beautiful nebulosity. Thanks friendo,1
I saw this at the end of cloverfield,1
"No, but I appreciate that!",1
"In a way, yes.

It's a meteoroid the whole time (unless it's larger than say 1 meter, and then it's an asteroid the whole time).  A meteor (also known as a shooting star) is the glowing streak it makes when it's heated up in the atmosphere, and a meteorite is the remnants of it after it's hit the earth.",1
Thanks. M38 is the larger cluster; NGC 1907 below it. There is an annotated image in the post that is linked in the OP.,1
"I love this image so much, do you have any source for me donate?",1
"I've caught a few while watching the Perseids in August before. They usually aren't as bright as this one would have been, but there's better chances to catch one then.",1
Is that a globular in the top left? if so do you know its designation?,1
"False alarm, the guy just had a gargantuan space fart",1
Came here to say that,1
that’s the one.,1
i’m feelin it,1
I think the word is 'groundbreaking',1

"One time I was at ""star party,"" an annual event at Grand Canyon National Park. Imagine literally hundreds of tourists with pupils the size of dinner plates wandering around in red-light with their necks at 90 degree angles. Amateur astronomers from the area set up telescopes let people look through them. 

Suddenly meteor like this glowed &amp; exploded in the sky.

The crowd completely lost it. It sounded like there had just been a home run at a baseball game.",1

"I dunno about “cold” but sure, it won’t be like a firework",1
I hope that you had a similar realization as I did - whenever possible look at the sky especially at night. Suddenly I realised how many meteors one can see... just fireballs are sooo rare :'),1
That's a pretty good ballpark.,1
"Meteors are a good 100-70km up when they are visible, so that's unlikely. They fall to the ground cold and dark, you never would have seen it land.

If the meteor was large enough that it did make it to the ground as a fireball the cricket field wouldn't be there anymore.",1

So awesome. Thanks for sharing. You’re giving NASA a run for their money!,1
"I use PixInsight.  The current settings I have in my description work very well in leveling them out (almost).  SII's readout is still a bit lower than the others, then Ha, and OIII is still usually higher, but not by too much.  Right, I won't capture OIII with the moon out.",1
"It indeed does. According to my research online seems that even at 3nm light pollution can still affect your Oiii image, even the moon to an extent. So that’s probably good advice for my skies.

Did you do testing of the readout between the 3 filters and figure out what worked in leveling them out? I’m still waiting for my 5nm Ha and Sii filters so I haven’t been able to do that exactly yet...

Are you using the Pixinsight script BaseCCDParameters to test those results?",1
"I notice OIII has a lot less light pollution protection than Ha and SII.  So by cutting the gain in half, I won't become over-exposed as quickly and I can still leave my exposure at 4 minutes.  This way my mean readout is very similar among all three narrowband filters.",1
"Hey there! What was your reasoning for changing the gain/offset between Ha/Sii and Oiii? 

I have the same camera but instead Astrodon 5nm Ha/Sii and 3nm Oiii filters. Bortle 8ish skies (yay Phoenix).

I’ve been personally using Gain 200 and Offset 50 for my NB based on the significant online research I’ve done, but not much practice yet (only 3 targets and ~6 months worth). But wanted to get your opinion.",1
"Thanks!  Depending on weather, this probably took 4 or 5 nights.  Alignment isn't hard because I never remove the camera from the telescope and I have software that can line up the target the exact same way every night.",1

This image is 4448x3280. *That's more than 4K resolution.* Either people don't check the actual resolution before asking for high res- or their idea of what constitutes high resolution is beyond reason.,1
u/Lewri summed it up perfectly,1
"Earth orbits the sun in an ellipse, as it gets closer to the sun, gravity speeds it up. Similarly, as it gets further away, gravity slows it down. 

It's therefore at its fastest when closest to the sun (called the perihelion) and slowest when it's furthest from the sun (called the aphelion).

According to [Curios Astro Cornell](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/41-our-solar-system/the-earth/orbit/85-how-fast-does-the-earth-go-at-perihelion-and-aphelion-intermediate), it is approximately 30300ms^-1 at the perihelion and 29300ms^-1 at the aphelion.",1
The orbital velocity.,1
I confirmed it's Eastern only.,1
"According to stellarium, the moon becomes 100% full at 0512 UTC since OP thinks that it's the same time globally. This means it's 12:12 on 12/12 only for those on Eastern time. 

I'm in mountain time, so this means nothing to me except to put my telescope away because the moon is too freaking bright.",1

"This is a molecular cloud that recently formed some stars. These stars are inside the nebula and are illuminating and blowing away the gas. You can see a little cluster of stars just to the left of the big black smear. You'll notice there's a sort of ""bubble"" around that cluster - this is where gas has been blown away by the new young stars. In particular, in the bottom you can see several ""pillar"" structures. This is where a particularly dense clump of gas has managed to hold on for a bit longer than its friends, while getting constantly eroded. It shields the gas behind it, so you get a ""pillar"" structure - you'll notice all the pillars point towards the same point, which is where the star cluster is.

Generally, the most interesting nebulae you see are molecular clouds, because you've got this complex interaction between bright young stars and dense gas going on, and you've got plenty of illumination from those bright young stars too.",1
"Yes, most astrophotographers view their pictures as art, me included.",1

That's a good questions.  I actually captured 333 four-minute exposures of this nebula across several nights and then combined all of the exposures together in post-processing.,1
"So, I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to this kind of thing.bur I’m curious. When you say 22hrs of data, does this mean you have the camera/telescope looking at the object for 22 hrs straight just taking one long exposure? ( I’m assuming not because of the daylight hours) Or is it combined over a period of nights and you stitch a ton of photos together with software?",1
Thanks.  This is not a natural color image as our eyes might have perceived it.  I stripped away the broadband data with special filters and went after the narrowband light and processed it in a way that NASA invented for the Hubble Space Telescope called the Hubble Palette.  Narrowband data really shows another deeper level of the nebula with more contrast.,1
Wow!,1
"Cool, glad to see you liked it enough to make it your background, thanks!",1
This is gorgeous! And also my new background. Thank you for your effort.,1

By 22 hours of data do you mean 22 hours of pictures layered on top of each other to form this picture?",1
"Hi :-)

This!

Yeah, the 4mm is pushing things. The $20 Celestron eyepieces are Plössl and Plössl are only good if they're over 10mm. Under 10mm, they're eye-relief is very poor. Especially the 4mm gets unusable.

The 6mm 66° is a great first addition.

"I'm not a scientist, but I can quote Wikipedia:  ""An emission nebula is a nebula formed of ionized gases that emit light of various wavelengths. The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby hot star. """,1
"You might be pushing it a little too much by starting off with a 4mm eyepiece. 

Every scope has their own maximum useful magnification, and I think the 4mm in that scope would only suit you well on nights where the seeing is exceptionally good.

If you over magnify, the image falls apart. I’d seriously consider asking r/telescopes or u/schorhr in particular before you purchase anything.

Wasting money on eyepieces sucks, I know from experience.",1

"Suggestions:

\- The black point is set too high and makes it look like a cutout. You should be able to see the transition into darkness near the terminator. A jet black sky also looks unnatural, there's no noise or grain or any indication that it's not a cutout on a black piece of paper. Pick an area outside the moon and it's near surroundings to set the black point as there's a bit of a light but almost imperceptible halo around it (due to diffraction.)

\- It looks like it was stretched pretty aggressively, so the noise has been amplified which means the finer detail is lost. Also the stretching has caused ringing (note how the edge of the moon almost looks inset or turned.)

Generally speaking, a more natural look tends to be better unless you're going for artistic appeal. Getting it non-full was good and it's even better when it's 1/4 or 3/4 phase (half on the left, or half on the right.) Figure out when the Lunar X will be visible and aim to image that. Always a challenge due to weather and timing.",1

"A black hole’s size is actually directly proportional to its mass. The event horizon is the point past which no light or information can escape, so the Schwarzchild Radius of a black hole can be calculated by setting the escape velocity of the black hole to the speed of light in a vacuum.

R (black hole) = 2GM / c^2

Where G is the gravitational constant, M is the black hole’s mass, and c is the speed of light.

Solving with M = 40,000,000,000 solar masses gives us the Schwarzchild radius of the black hole, which would be about 118 billion kilometers.",1

Closer to the top image,1
"Im afraid to that your lens is a beast in terms of weight. The lens alone would pretty much be at the max payload of the tracker.

I’d also be worried that the ball head wouldn’t be stable enough to keep it in place.

You would probably need to go with a star tracker like the skywatcher star adventurer pro or the ioptron skyguider pro.

They’re more expensive but the portability is a huge plus and you’ll get way longer sub exposures vs the Nyx.

I’d go read the sticky post at r/askastrophotography

Yeah! I'm super lucky my girlfriend is still with me after that night haha.,1
Looks like the loading screen of a horror survival game,1
On this case I blended the exposure of the light painted foreground because i could expose 10 more seconds for the sky and needed a higher iso. You can do super long exposures on the foreground to make it cleaner and blend it later with the sky (limited exposure without star tracker because of earth's rotation).,1
So do you edit two separate exposures together only to reduce noise in the foreground since you can use a lower ISO?,1
"Nope. If the exposure on the foreground is fine, the sky should be ok. Only if you're using a wide angle lens and you turn on a super flash light on the direction of the camera you can get some halos. They may appear on the sky or foreground.",1
"Thanks for the info! One more question since I've only done photos of the Milky Way w/o light painting: do you *have* to do this in two shots? i.e. does turning on the lamp for 5-10 seconds blow out the sky requiring you to have to do two sequential shots, one for the foreground and one for the sky?",1
"Wow. I never ever thought I’d want a telescope but I’m just thinking about it now, and my mind is blown realizing you could actually look at a galaxy. Can you see the spirals and all?",1
the stacking software I have used lets you define where it saves intermediate files. You should be able to configure it out based on how your system is put together (like multiple drive locations),1
"Thank you! So this is the least professional light source of all. It's a moon desk lamp 😅. It has 3 colors and you can change the intensity. Thought I could try some light painting with it.

There's a lot of trial and error but I think it was between 5 and 10 seconds.",1
Thanks for the information.,1
"Great shot! I have a question about light painting for the foreground shot. I've always wondered, what light source are you using to illuminate the mill and how long do you actually turn the light on for during the 20 sec exposure?",1
"With respect to your idea: If this was a recoiling supermassive black hole we would really only see the stars, because it's visible/infrared images. The other problem is the cluster around a recording SMBH is expected to be very compact, whereas this object looks somewhat resolved in the Hubble image. These are also expected to be extremely rare, and the chance of a random blob being one is quite unlikely unfortunately.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercompact_stellar_system

Radio data does exist for this field but the round object isn't listed in those catalogs, typically radio observations aren't sensitive to small or distant galaxies.",1
I cross posted this to a radio astronomy sub-reddit to see if anyone might radio observations of it.,1
"It's most likely a background galaxy, the rough estimate puts it about twice as distant as the merger galaxy. There is a possibility it could be a cluster or a dwarf galaxy that is part of the tidal tail, but most likely it's a background object.",1
I completely agree. Black hole felt a bit presumptuous of me. I'm still digging to see if I can find anything else?,1
What do you think is causing the circular disturbance within the tidal tail? And where did you find that image at?,1
"It could be a black hole 🤷‍♀️  
but I think it can also be something that's not emitting light visible by Hubble (i.e. not in  Near-infrared, visible light neither ultraviolet).  
It would be interesting to see that same part with other wavelengths",1
"This one is actually a tidal tail, not a lens. But funnily enough a galaxy right next to OPs one does have bright gravitationally lensed arc. [You can see both galaxies here.](https://imgur.com/a/zDFLugE) The lensed galaxy is the blue arc on the red galaxy. You can see the arc is very close to the galaxy doing the lensing, there always has to be something massive doing the bending.",1
You’ll enjoy that 8 inch dob. Get yourself some goldline eyepieces to go with it.,1
"So what do you think the circular structure in the tidal tail is? My hypothesis is that the circular structure is dusk, gas, and a few stars still locked in orbit around the super massive black hole post collision.",1
"From these images it's quite clear it's a tidal tail, it's material which has been pulled away from the galaxy by an interaction with another galaxy. You see the tail leads to a galaxy which is clearly very disturbed, it's not a nice elliptical or disk, it's a train wreck. The loop on one side is not normal. From the galaxy it looks like the galaxy merger has already happened, and the tidal tail is a remnant of that process. Tidal tails can also form before the real merger, so it may be the sign of an ongoing interaction.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_tail

This galaxy was mentioned in a paper about tidal tails, but the image is much worse than yours.

So if lensing... what's causing it?,1
"**Gravitational lens**

A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.  (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity.)Although Einstein made unpublished calculations on the subject in 1912, Orest Khvolson (1924) and Frantisek Link (1936) are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print. However, this effect is more commonly associated with Einstein, who published an article on the subject in 1936.Fritz Zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses.

I'll see what I can do to get a few more images up.,1

Tracking is simply the rotation of the right ascension axis at sidereal rate. Autoguiding is sending corrections to the mount if it goes off course. To locate objects most people use platesolving.",1

Pixinsight for image processing

There is a great write up stickied at the top of r/askastrophotography that explains the most budget friendly way to get in to the hobby.

The mount is the most important piece of equipment, and a lot of people start with a simple star tracker like the skywatcher star adventurer pro.",1

If you take that photo for 10 seconds you will actually be able to see the core.

If you expose for several minutes at a time, you’ll be able to stretch the data to see the arms of the galaxy.

That’s where a star tracker or an equatorial mount comes in to play.",1

"It depends on a lot of factors. Your light pollution level, quantum efficiency of the camera sensor, pixel size, focal ratio of the telescope, brightness of the object.

You try to get as much total exposure time as possible. It's not uncommon to see people get 20-30 hours on one object.

You can look at my profile to see what 4.5 hours of Andromeda looks like with my gear, from my light pollution level (bortle 6).",1
Gotchya. How many photos would you normally take for something close like the andromeda then? I assume it varies with whatever equipment you have.,1
"That is correct for planetary and lunar imaging. DSO is different, you take photos instead.",1
Nice! Keep it up.,1
Cool.  Enjoy.,1
"It may be the most visible galaxy, you can see the core with the naked eye in dark skies. If you could see the arms, the galaxy would appear huge. It would appear to be roughly 5 or 6 full moons in the night sky.

I think the “cheap” part of it may be the problem. If you look through something like an 8 inch dobsonion telescope under dark skies you should be able to make out some detail of andromeda, but yes you do need very long exposure times and data stretching to make out the detail you see in photos.

Not all nebula are faint though, the Orion Nebula is pretty bright. In the Astrophotography sub there are plenty of photos that people have taken untracked with very short exposure times which is pretty remarkable.",1
"Just because something has been done before, doesn't mean to say it cant be done again. Lots of photo compositions can be classed as ""cliche"" but that still shouldn't prevent people from capturing those images themselves.

This is how people learn and develop as photographers, by trying new techniques.   
Yes, i have seen lots of photos like this and i'm sure that OP has too, but that doesn't take away from the positives that should be gained from this picture like.

It does not give the same result. You are taking the average of two averages when you stack that way.,1
What is your favorite objective to photograph in the sky ?,1
"Solar wind speed is higher over coronal holes. The temperature and density over coronal holes is low, and the magnetic field is weak, so the field lines are open to space. As you get farther from the sun, the magnetic field strength drops faster than the pressure of the material, so it starts to act more like a gas, and less like a magnetically structured plasma, so it can go a lot faster.",1
"A lot of people get started with a star tracker, which are roughly $400.

With the telescope, the skies the limit (no pun intended).

But you can even use something smaller for andromeda.

"In dark skies with a larger telescope you can make out some details but andromeda is pretty faint.

The data at the very least has to be stretched in post processing to make out the details that you see in these photos.",1

Looks like someone spilled Tang powder on a shiney black table and photographed it with a flash.,1
"Stay away from buying any low priced Celestron telescopes. They are usually not good for what you get. The telescope you mentioned is put on a weak equatorial mount, it will vibrate for like 3-5 seconds every time you touch it, and the equatorial mount requires you to learn a new coordinate system, polar alignment, etc.

The optics are fine, but the mount is just not fun to use.

Pretty much everyone will recommend a 6 or 8 inch dobsonian telescope for beginners. The reason for this is because you get the most aperture for your money, and because of the simple design they are VERY easy to use and extremely stable.

Aperture is what will determine how much magnification you can use, and how much light your scope collects.

The Sky-Watcher 8"" dob is about $379 USD right now, and it's an infinitely better value for your money than the Celestron 130.

Also, stay away from reading any reviews online that link to Amazon, they don't know shit about telescopes and just want affiliate link money.",1
Thanks... I read the reviews and it seems pretty good... what kind of thing can you view with them?,1
"Haha I do, I actually linked to your from your post with the Hubble palette. Follow you on Instagram too. Great stuff",1
I have the Celestron Skymaster 15x70 binoculars and they’ve been great for me. Really good value.,1
"Thank you. It’s a little intimidating there, because I understand so little. I read the sidebar, and I got more confused. There is a Celestron 130 in my price range, plus the kit with a Barlow and other lenses/filters that I am considering. All in, around $500+. Is that a good start? I understand that is a deceptively complicated question.",1
Same. And honestly all it starts with is getting a DSLR camera. Follow r/astrophotography,1
Head over to r/telescopes if you eventually decide to get one - the people on there will help you out a lot.,1
"This is super interesting, and could get my kids more excited about a good telescope.",1
"A telescope large enough for the 90mm (which has a 900mm or so focal length) to make sense as a finder would need a very large mount if it was to be mounted as an EQ.

Conversely a 900mm focal length refractor doesn't make much sense as a finder for a Dob because it will put the eyepiece in a fairly inconvenient location low down, again unless the Dob is some huge monster.

I would suggest getting a dob for now and just keeping an eye on ebay/cloudynights classifieds/craigslist/whatever, good used mounts do come up.",1

That is so amazing its practically like a vacum when you are in it but looks opaque from such a distance!!

Dust clouds really facinates me as it is the engines of creation. 

Created more complex matter like you and Me!",1
I see a little silhouetto of a man,1
"So it's mostly hydrogen and helium gas, at maybe 1-100 particles per cm^-3 in a dense cloud like this. But the gas part is basically transparent. About 1% of that mass is in dust grains, which actually are quite good at absorbing light. But that's still a very low density of them, so you need to look through a large depth for it to become opaque. We're talking light years, even at a quite high density. So if you're sitting in it, distant stars will be dimmed or even invisible, but local space will basically seem like a total vacuum.",1
"What's the name of the globular cluster at the right top of the image? Excellent photo, btw",1
"So cool, and thanks for sharing. I want to pick this up as a serious hobby so badly",1
I found a few that look ok I just though this would be the sub Reddit that would know of a good one,1
I don't think you are gonna find a decent tracking mount (never mind the scope) for $400,1

_________________

This is a great reflection nebulae known as NGC 6726. Reflection nebulae are floating clouds of microscopic dust that end up scattering nearby starlight through a process known as Rayleigh Scattering. This is actually the same process that goes on in our atmosphere causing it to be blue, which in turn is the reason this nebulae is a sky blue color! The compounds that make up the dust component are carbon compounds (a mixture of graphite and diamonds) along with some other elements like iron and nickel. 

This particular nebula is another one of the many targets mainly visible from the southern hemisphere. One of the many targets I have been able to take advantage of with the opening of our new observatory located in the Atacama Desert of Chile. While this setup is still in the preliminary stages of testing, [we do have other setups available for public use, or free data sets you can download.](https://deepskywest.com/)

"Go on r/telescopes, you'll get better answers there. A barlow lens increases the magnification of any eyepiece you put in it by a specified amount, like 2x or 3x. *More magnification is not always better.* I recommend getting a nice eyepiece, that will improve your viewing experience more than a barlow will.",1
You can see many of the objects on this list with the naked eye under ideal conditions. Just not as clearly as these pictures.,1

"Heat only transfers at the speed of light as radiation, so for example heat passing between two touching objects, like a radiator and the air, transfers due to the collision of atoms. heat is the vibration of atoms in an object, and zero Kelvin is the total absence of heat, so if an object reaches zero Kelvin, it's Adams physically stop vibrating and would become completely motionless. The object would stay a solid object though.",1
If heat transfers at the speed of light,1
"Nope. I assume you mean we're both infrared photons that were emitted at different intervals. In that case, we are both be traveling, assuming we're both in a vacuum, at the speed of light. So there be no Doppler effect.",1
"I tried this, but it does not seem to work for me.  I downloaded  [u/marioz1125](https://www.reddit.com/user/marioz1125/)'s picture, clicked the details, but I have almost no metadata showing up.  I get the file name 9o7bwpc3yb341 . jpg , when I downloaded it, dimensions, resolution, bit depth, and that's about it.  I don't get the camera model, the focal length, the date and time taken, f/stop, iso, lens maker, etc. like I do for pictures off my camera. 

Am I doing something wrong?  Does it work for you, [peter-doubt](https://www.reddit.com/user/peter-doubt/)? Can you tell the contrast level, saturation, the date and time Mario's picture was taken?",1
"Transfer it to a computer... In MS windows, pick the file and check 'properties' and 'details'.  Is your camera imprinting copyright details? It probably can, but you can add it on a computer.",1

And then you have things like the [Hubble Ultra Deep Field] (https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0611b/) which would be a bit larger than a 6x6 pixel box in this picture.,1
To be fair the telescope was a gift so it has sentimental value to me. I see your point though.,1
People overlook the Coolpix for astrophotography but they do pretty good for basic stuff.,1
"Actually, when I saw the date, my reaction was just the opposite of yours, u/jannne.  I thought to myself that someone is actually letting us know something useful.  

What if I, or you, want to make a similar photo?  For example, young Mario captured Langrenus beautifully, and I'd like to do something similar.  I'd like to know when this was taken.

Yes, it is captured in metadata but that does not do me any good.  Is there a way for me to get the metadata from this picture?  I can't do it.  I don't think that I have access to the metadata.  In any case, metadata often gets stripped.",1
"Oh yeah I turned it on and off from now and then just because I use this camera for everything, I just photoshop out the date stamp when I need to",1

"Yup, I've actually photographed the Andromeda galaxy with my small 72 mm refractor telescope. You can check out the image on my Reddit profile.",1
"What do you mean by that? Andromeda is approximately 3-6x wider than the full moon. It really depends on what image you use to compare, because some pictures show Andromeda as being bigger than others since they had more exposure time so the faint regions showed up better.

I mean, look at these two andromeda pictures that are orientated and scaled properly:  [https://i.imgur.com/9QSrOlv.png](https://i.imgur.com/9QSrOlv.png)

Theoretically, it should be possible.  After all, Johannes Kepler was able to make these calculations before there were any computers or even telescopes.  (Don't forget to account for the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn)

But you are going to have a bigger problem: you will not have enough time to be able to gather enough data to make these calculations.  You should have several years of data to really figure this out.  From observing it for a month you are not going to have enough data.  It would be akin to seeing someone biking around the campus of your school, and you observing him for 10 seconds while also walking.  You just can't tell what your path and his path are going to be.  

Just use historical data to do the calculations.",1

I think that you should find a telescope that has what you are looking for, regardless of the refractor.  But if you narrow your choice of telescopes to two telescopes that are pretty much the same except that on one you could mount your refractor but not on the other, then it would make a difference.",1

A stable enough mount (especially one that holds two scopes) will cost way more than what your scope is worth. Do what u/Gusto88 recommended and get a big dob.,1
"You don't even need a telescope, just a camera. The problem will be that you need a tracking mount to take longer exposures, but you can get fairly good wide-angle results (i.e. a large chunk of the sky) with a decent digital camera and a tripod!

"I'd recommend using binoculars. Literally just pop out your phone, use NightSky or something similar. You'll know the general direction, so use your binos and you should find the object pretty easily. Then use your telescope.",1
Yes--one night a full moon was right next to Andromeda and I was shocked that it was so much smaller Than Andromeda,1
LMC is approximately 10 degrees wide. It orbits the Milky Way and is significantly closer to us than Andromeda.,1
That's because the moon is only 0.5-1 light second in distance compared to 2.5 million light years away for Andromeda.,1

"I assume your question is ""why is the moon the only object in the image we can see with the naked eye""?

The answer is because of their luminosity (or brightness). In astronomy, we use the term ""apparent magnitude"" to scale the luminosity of objects in the sky when seen from Earth. The most faint objects a person can see with the naked eye is about 6-7 on the scale, so for example Uranus is barely visible (under dark skies and seeing conditions). You can read about it here:

What kind of radius would the event horizon of a black hole this large have?,1
"You'll be able to see jupiter and saturn a bit. Enough to tell what they are for sure. The moon will look great. If you have some dark skies point it at Andromeda and triangulum galaxies. It helps to understand what you're looking at to to appreciate what you're seeing. I have a 8"" Dobsonian and I have to explain to people what you see in pictures isn't what you see in the eyepiece, they're usually a little disappointed in see fuzzy white blobs and I believe this is where a lot of poor reviews come from. Don't get me wrong it is still a cheap scope. But you learn the night sky very well, and gives you a start and if you wanna go further in the hobby you're not out much. Just give it a shot on any objects, just try to understand appreciate what you are seeing and then maybe the draw to see more will lead you to things like astrophotography.",1

I've always wanted to get into astronomy and astrophotography but never had the time, energy or money to learn about it. 

I have attempted filming lunar eclipses and tried several times to view Jupiter and it's moons through a basic telescope, so I have a tiny inkling of how difficult your image must have been.

i have to disappoint you, you won't be able to se nebuae or galaxies like in this picture with the naked eye, the night sky is still impressive tho

but there is hope, our astrophysics professor told us you can even see colours of the orion nebula in real time by looking through a mirror telescope with 3 metres in diameter",1
"Sorry, it was a mistake.",1
"Yes of course, you can see a lot with this. Maybe not crystal clear views but closer things for sure you'll see them in a totally new magical way. There's a full moon next Wednesday, Dec 11. I think it should be rising a little before dark. Take your telescope out if the weather is clear and enjoy the view.",1
It's 3.1/5 not 3.1/10 LOL,1
Could be anything... its out of focus.,1
So are you saying I could possibly view celestial planets with this? I don't know much about telescope parts. Could you analyse them for me and tell me a rating out of 10?,1
It’s a Meade Autostar,1
That sensation is called cosmic vaulting.,1
"You'd be surprised what you can see with even the most basic of telescopes. Experiment with it and if there are things you want to view more specifically, save up for a newer better one. Everyone needs a starter telescope!",1
I wish I can see something other than the moon every night... Damn suburb light pollution. I can just very very very faintly see Pleiades at night if it’s a new moon and the streetlights behind my house are out and the neighbors don’t turn on their driveway lights...,1
"It’s a Meade Autostar, I’m not seeing a specific model number or anything",1
What kind of scope are you using ?  Brand and model please.,1
I try to imagine this sometimes. What does our galaxy look like from a planet on the outer arms of Andromeda.,1
"Could you give a bit more information? I thought stars just looked like dots, I’m really sorry I just got my telescope not long ago and it’s like a whole new world!",1
Looks like maybe you were pointed at a star but your scope was out of focus.,1
I did not see a fourth. Maybe they are coming the middle of the second one also as a separate Galaxy? Still does not make sense,1
If you’re in the US I hear Big Bend national park is the place to go.,1
I love me some gravitational distortion,1
"Even in a bright sky you can see it with a pair of binoculars. It’s mostly a smudge though. 

It’s what convinced me to get into astrophotography. Even with just a tripod and camera I was able to take and stack (30) 1” exposures and brought out a lot more detail.",1
This is a great comparison. I wish I could visit southern hemisphere to see lmc.,1
"Ahhh, check out that gravitational distortion just for a second. Nice.",1
"Here’s the thing. The outer edges of andromeda that you have no trouble seeing in that long exposure shot are basically impossible to see with human eyes inside our atmosphere. If we could see 100% of the light  from andromeda unmitigated by the atmosphere and the aperture of the human eye, it would look as huge as you can see it in the picture. In a truly dark place I’ve only ever seen the visible core region look about as wide as the full moon. Maybe a little larger.",1
"(Though scales are accurate, naked-eye appearance not as shown. Except the Pleiades. Some nights. And almost the Large Megellanic Cloud. Most color and brightness added for effect. Alas.)",1
"I had an opportunity to go sailing in the Bahamas (away from any major islands) a few years back. That's probably the closest I'll ever get to a dark sky. Looking at the sky and its reflection over the calm black water you almost got a sense of weightlessness and being suspended. Almost a disorienting feeling, seeing thousands if not millions of stars in the sky. Definitely worth it to see, hope I can do something like that again one day",1
Hahahha they dont even look like lunar rocks lol,1
"hmm interesting I never realized how small the moon is compared to all these other celestial objects

r/starsub",1
Yes that's definitely true!,1
Oh Gaga i thought it was how big it is compared to other objects from the surface and was like andromeda is tiny,1
I’ve been wondering what this would look like for a while! Thanks and great job!,1
I can recommend you trying a method called star hopping. Or using some kind of app. And you just have do this for some time to get a hang of it.,1
"You are correct - I think it’s 3 degrees across, that’s where I made a mistake",1
"Was in a area with zero light pollution, but there was so many stars i couldn't navigate my way around them.",1
"Never seen anything but moon and a couple of stars, venus and/or mars. Fucking civic life.",1
The biggest issue is that these things are all pretty dim. The human eye isn't really sensitive enough to see the full structure.,1
Quality post 👏👏👏,1
You might want to submit this to APOD. I think they would like this as a great way to show angular sizes of objects.,1
Maybe you're in an area with big light pollution. Also you can never see objects like this in the telescope. Those are long exposure photographs,1
The stars are indeed spectacular but all the other deep sky objects look just like smudges. Different story if you have a big telescope of course,1
"And i couldn't find any with my 8in skywatcher last week , i think im doing something wrong",1
"The hilarious part is his description.  He admits that everywhere he has submitted samples, they have informed him they’re not meteorites.  His takeaway is that the scientist are lying in order to protect the value of their own collections.",1
" RA and Dec are referenced to the celestial sphere. The stars are at fixed RA/Dec. Planets wander around. 

any time of year a star will always be at the same RA/Dec. 

The planets however are in motion in relation to the celestial sphere. So if you take measurements every night or every week of a planet you will notice the RA/Dec changing while the background stars stay the same.",1
"Damn that's impressive especially those nebulas! I did shoot soke night photos with Abdromeda galaxy and a lot with the Pleiades on it! The nebulas were the part that I didn't understand properly haha, don't know too kuch about those! But thanks a lot man :)",1
"Unfortunately even without light pollution the large majority of nebula emit hydrogen alpha light, which has a wavelength of 656 nm. This light is close to infrared, and as a result human eyes are not that sensitive to it. 

It also appears red, so that is why almost all nebulae look red because they usually contain a very large amount of gas.

If you were in space and had 100x more sensitive eyes then they would appear as you see in the image.",1
"I believe you with that! Thats impressive, so if the sky allowed it (without light pollution etc) you could see them from here bigger or as big as the moon? Like you stated in this image",1
Not counting the possibility of life in our own galaxy...It's wild to look at Andromeda and think about the possibility of life looking back.,1
"Captured with a XT8 telescope and a canon T3i.

[This video shows the process used to capture and develop the images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CVxcPoM8Xg). 

Text version:

I attach my camera to my telescope with a T-ring adaptor, and 2X Barlow lens (required for this particular telescope to reach focus properly).

I record a 1080p video and use 3X digital zoom to increase the size of the object. 

I set the object into the middle of the frame and let it drift by (my telescope has no tracking). 

I take the video files and run them through a program called [PiPP](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/) to stabilize the frames and convert the video file to a more suitable format for stacking. 


I take the video files and stack the frames with [AutoStakkert](https://www.autostakkert.com/).

I take the output file and bring out more details with a program called [Registax](https://www.astronomie.be/registax/).

I do this 20-30 times to create enough frames to make a timelapse. 

I used photoshop to manually align the frames and output a video file from there. 


Any questions, feel free to ask!",1
"Yes, they are several times bigger than the moon. The reason you can't see them at night is because of light pollution, and most of them are too dim aswell.",1
"Sorry but can you ELI5? Haha, I'm very interested in this but those object are never as big as the moon are they? At least from our perspective then :)",1
"If you go to a dark place you can see it with your eyes, but of course it won't look nearly as spectacular as it does in pictures.",1
"wdym, the moon is absolutely astronomicaly gigantic, astonishing! I didn’t even know this... is... is it actually the gravitational center of our universe?
/(im)s(orry)",1
"This makes me hope I'll find a place without light pollution one day, so I may one day see what the night sky truly looks like.",1
"Es ist nicht tot, was ewig liegt, bis dass die Zeit den Tod besiegt",1
"Woah! Andromeda is THAT big in the night sky?

I wish it was easily visible with the naked eye!",1
"this really wants to make me travel yo the southern hemisphere, magellanic cloud looks sick",1
"I don't understand. To track if the object is moving you have to measuring its position change over time. The Ra and Dec cannot stay the same if the object is moving, so what is the zero referenced to? Some star perhaps? I'll Google it...",1
Ra and Dec of the object. They don't transform in anyway,1
"Ra and Dec according to what reference, please?",1
Wow! This is really cool and made my day a little less sad!,1
These kind of fakes are incredibly common in every public online marketplace where you can get meteorits. The more incideous fakes are the ones where people try to fake the looks of a fusion-crusted chondrite with clay and put some kind of steel on the inside to make it a bit magnetic.,1

**Note: The LMC and Carina Nebula are only visible in the southern hemisphere.**

Not everything in space is small, many objects are actually much bigger than the Moon. People largely overestimate the size of our Moon, [when in reality it is only only *half a degree in width, or a tic-tac held at arms length.*](https://youtu.be/qMALXeeTZlA?t=366) Compare this to the LMC, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, which is 20 times wider than the full Moon.

This graphic was created by calculating the amount of angular width each pixel represents in the sky, for the main image. This value came out to be 29.3 arcseconds / pixel, or in other terms, every pixel only represents 1/120th of a degree. Various images online were gathered and scaled to the proper dimensions.",1
That's the beauty of the ra and dec system. Just write down the ra and dec every night. And that should be enough to show you.,1
"right now you can spot it near sunset, it'll be east of the sun. you should see Venus and Jupiter in the same area as well.",1
Same here. I am amazed,1
What tf?,1
"Thank you - I think I get it. Since the equipment has spherical coordinates as output I should be able to transform them to cartesian coordinates as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_coordinate_transformations#From_spherical_coordinates), and use a curve-fitting tool to see if the path of the planet trace an elliptic orbit.

How do I find its true position relative to the day before? I am sure that I have to take into account that the earth is spinning around itself and around the sun at the same time. How does one compensate for these two movements?",1
"If you have a telescope that is put onto an equatorial mount, you could locate mars visually, and then write down its coordinates by looking at the markings for each axis.

"Thank you.

I want to find it through a telescope, with direct observation.",1
I was talking about celestial hemispheres.,1
"Open up Stellarium, and click on Mars. It will give you its celestial coordinates.",1
"Technically Sirius is in space and not in either of Earth’s hemispheres. It’s visible from both, but in neither.",1
That is a great question. I doubt there are coordinates but I want to know how,1
If it's both then it's likely to be the sun ;),1
Technically Sirius is below the celestial horizon so it's in the southern hemisphere.,1
you find it in the sky,1
Venus is low in the west after sunset right now and is easily the brightest object after the moon. Mars comes up just before sunrise in the east as a bright reddish 'star'. Or you could be noticing Sirius - the brightest star in the northern hemisphere - as it rises in the evening following the constellation of Orion.,1
That is an insane photo man thanks for sharing. Its crazy how compact they all get i wonder how it would look near the center. Thanks man,1
it’s the one with the rings,1
In the milky way next to Jupiter.,1
Huh,1
"The stars are denser the closer you get to the core - there's more of them and they're closer together. 

If you take a look at [one of the more ridiculous composites of Andromeda the Hubble assembled awhile ago](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/) you can see the starfields getting tigher as you move from the edge to the core.",1

&gt; &amp;quot;Trying to understand the evolution of the neutral hydrogen that pervaded the early universe is really the last unexplored space on our cosmic map,&amp;quot; says Chris Carilli, chief scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and a contributor to the HERA project.

&gt; PAPER was just the first step on the road to an even larger telescope array designed to detect the low frequency emissions of neutral hydrogen from the early universe: HERA. With nearly three times as many antennas as PAPER, HERA stands to be one of the most sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes ever built.

&gt; Ultimately, the HERA team hopes to create a &amp;quot;Movie&amp;quot; of the large-scale evolution of the universe that occurred directly before and after the first stars were formed.

chill dick head obviously i dont know exactly how it all works that was just what i thought jesus,1
Thanks for the help!,1
"That would work, and you'd be right, but... the nearest mall is 45 minutes away from me. I have school and other stuff that takes up way too much time lol.",1
I think because of high density of cosmic objects like stars and pulsars,1
Do you have a mall near you?  Just go to every store and ask if they are hiring/fill out an application then and there....  It might be a sucky first job but I bet you can get hired even for a couple weeks for the holiday season to get some work.,1
"I recommend the iOptron Skyguider Pro. It's an entry level tracking mount that doesn't cost much, and it also works very well.",1
"Man to think we're looking at something 2 million years in the past, this is great op",1
"Well, there are lots of galaxies out there.  

If you are just starting out, check out the Messier catalog. It has about 110 objects that includes the objects are the easiest to see from the Northern hemisphere that are not planets or stars.  This includes about 40 galaxies.  

The most famous, and the most utilized catalog of non-planetary, non-stellar objects is NGC, which does both hemispheres, and should have pretty much every object that you can see with a decent telescope.",1
Awesome! Are there any potential targets besides M87* and Sgr A*? I think I've read that those are the only black holes considered feasible for imaging with current technology,1
What are you saying now?  Black holes don't keep the universe together,1
Then wouldn’t be 4 galaxies? A galaxy within a galaxy within a galaxy within a galaxy?,1
Wait till you get to Bode Miller’s Galaxy or the Puss in Boots void. /s,1
"Feel free to recommend specific videos (also books, but I might be too lazy to read them)",1
"It is an IACT telescope ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IACT)). The important feature that make it different from a regular telescope is its incredibly high, nano-second time resolution, which is needed in order to detect the photon showers which come from high energy particles striking the atmosphere. The incredibly big mirror helps it with this, as having such a high time resolution means you need to collect more light to get above the noise level.",1
"You do a lot of research, and watch videos of people that have already done it on YouTube.

Personally, I've bought 2 books as well, it helps to understand the theory behind what you're doing.",1

"She is brilliant. I am a particle physicist and have never done astronomy, but where do you start to get to this?",1
CMOS.,1
"To an extent.   Jupiter and Saturn are kind of butterscotch colored, and the red spot is reddish.  On a good night you can see the stripes.  

Mars is red.  And you can imagine canals if you want a connection to the past.  And venus is bright white.... and if you have a refractor it is good for showing chromic aberration.",1
It was a poorly thought-out headline and not a very good article anyway.,1
Can you see color in planets? I assume so,1
There is a whole mess of them.  Look up the NGC catalogue and you can get any information you need about all of the known galaxies.  Just to warn you though it’s a very extensive list.,1
"It takes a really, really big scope to see anything remotely approaching what you see in pictures.  There's no color outside of the planets and the color of a star - everything else is grey, most requires averted vision to see anything cool.  

But seeing it with your own eyes is just.... different.  Looking into blackness and seeing a blizzard of stars and gas with your own eyes is just amazing... even if it doesn't live up to even the most average of photographs. 

In today's world with digital techniques, amateurs are getting photos that would have been impossible with the best telescopes in the world less than a hundred years ago.  It really is amazing.",1
"The third is the small ring Galaxy viewed through it. Yes, you are correct, they call the ring and the center as two galaxies.",1

No problem,1
Thanks! It was my first real attempt at the Milky Way. Still couldn’t get far enough away from light pollution to get a better shot unfortunately.,1

I think it's 5-6 if I'm not mistaken.,1
Yes but it's absolutely tiny compared to the galaxy.,1

"In the center, to the left of the milky way, - Sagittarius and Saturn is a bit to the top. Jupiter is the brightest spot on the right side.",1
If you get an the app. Even the free version. You can have your location and time and figure it out decently. It becomes more difficult when you see so many stars but it's helpful. Awesome picture btw.,1
Very good work. Well done 👍,1
Yeah it's mirrored. It just looked to me like the picture came out mirrored. I didn't analyze it to terribly much. Just figured that was saturn off to the right. So made them line up.,1
"Okay help me read this, is it supposed to be mirrored?",1
Figured flipping it was the best way to line up what you're seeing. Using stellarium+ on Android. Also free for pc. Helps me a lot,1

Oh gotcha. Still learning out to read stars and where they are at certain times.,1
M31 would have been a little more North and almost directly overhead I imagine,1
Awesome! I thought maybe that’s what it was. Or maybe m-31,1

"It was taken by an iPhone 6s connected to a Celestron Omni XLT 150 via a universal cell phone mount. It is unedited and taken through, I believe it was, a 9mm eyepiece.",1
The phone takes a total of 1m 6s of exposure then stacks the images and removes noise. There are so many stars in this photo that I could not see with my eyes.,1
"A little more information would be nice.

At the very least, what kind of telescope, brand, model, size, etc?

Any software used on the phone or to edit image?",1
"If you don't want to buy a goto mount, which are an extremely expensive jump from a simple mount, you can buy a motor with tracking. It doesn't search automatically, but it can track for a bit of time, you have to have a good polar alignment though. I found one for my eq-5 for 140 euros.",1
"My advices would be:

\- Join a local amateur astronomy club. This is the fastest way you'll learn about the sky and the one you'll enjoy the most. You'll meet a lot of experienced people who share your passion and lov to share their knowledge, specially with people who are just starting in the hobby. They'll probably have star parties and teach courses on different related subjects.

\- Download Stellarium and start playing with it. Play with the time controls. What happens as the hours go by? What happens if you look at the same place of the sky at the same hour as the days go by? That way you'll start to get a grasp about the movements of the sky. Go out and try to identify the objects you see and that grab your attention by whatever reason (because they're bright, or their location or disposition, etc.). Start with one constellation. Right now you have Scorpius up in the sky, with Antares being a very identifiable star. Sagittarius is by the side. Those are summer constellations (for the northern hemisphere). Jupiter and Saturn are there too right now. If you stay up late enough, you'll see Orion rising to the East, a very identifiable winter constellation. Find Rigel (the blue bright star in it) and Betelgeuse (the bright red star). You'll find Aldebaran (another bright red star) from Taurus at one side, and the Pleyades if you keep going in that direction. From Orion to the other side you'll see another very bright blue star, that's Sirius, from Canis Major. One you're familiar with those, you star identifying other bright objects nearby.

\- Read some books on the subject. When I was starting I read ""Stargazing for dummies"" and ""Astronomy for dummies"" and I found them very helpful. I've seen ""Turn left at Orion"" recommended a lot here, so I'm guessing it's a classic, but I never read it. Surely there's a lot more.

\- Check out Crash Course: Astronomy in YouTube or [Alexander Spahnn's General Astronomy Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNycEeeRg4mXbYSrbzsAdubj1qcubqsz-). I also second the Neil deGrasse Tyson and Brian Cox documentaries suggested by others.",1

*****
&gt; Making monster galaxies When two spiral galaxies - like our Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy - collide, they can merge and form an elliptical galaxy.

&gt; Their central black holes combine as well and make larger black holes, which can kick huge swaths of nearby stars out to the edges of the newly formed galaxy.

&gt; The resulting extra-large elliptical galaxy usually doesn&amp;#039;t have much gas from which to form new stars, so its center looks pretty bare after its black hole kicks out nearby stars.

There's quite a few really good ones through the year. Geminids are my favourite because of the meteor frequency but it's less famous and regarded than the perseids which are in the summer because they're brighter and in the summer when the weather is better.,1
"As others have mentioned videos work well for shooting planets, they’re so bright that a photo of them can be captured at a shutter speed well under 1 second.

Therefore you can take a video of it at 20-30 frames per second and in little time at all you basically have thousands of photos to stack.

Deep space objects in the other hand are so dim that you can’t even see a lot of them with the naked eye. You would have to keep the shutter of the camera open for minutes at a time to capture the light being emitted from the object. 

So if someone says 2 hours of total integration time, that could be 60 frames, at 2 minutes of exposure time each, or 30 frames at 4 minutes of exposure time each.

If you can control camera noise, longer exposures are generally better.

Either way for a shot like this, it’s not video. It’s many many long exposure shots stacked to give you one single final image.",1

But really just showing that the Moon is visible in the daytime is a good start (and explaining why), because it is very common in children's books to associate Moon with night, despite it very often being up during the day.  Only the full Moon rises at night!",1

"There is a huge difference in what you see through a telescope vs what you get in the picture. The image in the top left is what you'd expect to see with a 12 inch diameter telescope in a very dark place. 

Humans were not designed to view space objects. Most nebulae emit light at the hydrogen alpha line, 656 nm. Your eyes have a very hard time detecting this light since it's almost infrared, so even if you were to go on a spaceship and fly to the helix nebula it would be black and white, or maybe red if you're lucky.

Also, most things in space are extremely faint. For example, the edges of the Andromeda Galaxy only emit a few *photons* per second onto each camera pixel. That is why people do 10, 20, 40 hour exposures.

The ""raw"" images that come from the camera look very similar to the final image. The only difference is that you apply changes to make it more appealing such as colour saturation, or HDR. It's impossible to bring out any detail that doesn't already exist.",1
I’ve made requests for people to post a series of pics of what you could expect to see through a decent telescope. Like setting expectations right for buying a $300-$500 telescope... pictures and what you see are very different.,1

I edited this photo awhile ago and it was my first multi night project. During this time I kept changing the spacing of the field flattener, which was probably the reason for the large amounts of chromatic aberration. 

I found it really hard to get the colour I wanted on the outer regions and the core. It took me 3 revisions to get the colour you see.

Any comments and critique are welcome, thanks.

"In a large telescope, Jupiter is bright enough kill your night vision. It takes several minutes to even start getting it back. Planets are bright enough that you can easily overexpose them, so they look pure white.  Nebulae and galaxies are captured in long exposure photographs, but planets are usually shoot at daytime speeds.  Venus and Jupiter are two of the brightest things in the sky, other than the Sun and Moon. Venus and Jupiter can be the first things you see when the sun sets, if they are out.",1
"Well that’s what planets basically are; a large clump of dust (or gas). So technically yes, a large enough piece of dust could be brighter than a star. A full moon is brighter than the brightest star in the sky, Sirius. 

I think you need to understand how telescopes work. You can think of one as a large bucket which collects rain - in terms of a telescope, the bucket is the primary mirror or lens, and the rain is photons emitted or reflected by whatever your viewing. By having a larger telescope, you’ll basically collect more light, meaning that the view will be brighter. But as you magnify, the view gets dimmer. The brightness of an image is determined by the exit pupil.

Exit pupil (diameter of the light beam exiting the eyepiece) is determined by the focal length of your eyepiece divided the focal ratio of your scope. So a f/5 scope with a 10mm eyepiece will deliver a 2mm exit pupil, and a 2.5mm eyepiece will deliver a 0.5mm exit pupil (which is already pretty dim). The smaller the exit pupil, the dimmer the image is because your pupil collects very little light.

So, you are saying a reflection off dust is brighter than a star??

These racist undertones (if you can even call them that since they’re so prominent in the stories they’re in) aren’t present in all of his works, though. If you find they take away from the stories (which is totally legitimate, not everyone can simply look past it) then you can read the ones with no or minimal racism.

&gt;The Mössbauer effect, or recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, is a physical phenomenon discovered by Rudolf Mössbauer in 1958. It involves the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma radiation by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in Mössbauer spectroscopy.

&gt;In the Mössbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. **When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.**

"I believe you can. However while you can do it provided you correct for the rotation curve of the galaxy you're in, I don't think its ideal. For example, the Milky Way's cosmic year is roughly 200 million Earth years. This is too large to use. We need to keep our timekeeping as simple and as relevant as possible. 

Here's how I thought about it. 

  
We start simple. 

Earth takes 23 hrs 56mins 4s to rotate about it's axis. Here it is conveniently decided that Earth days are to be divided into 24 hours. Time is synchronized using the prime meridian in Greenwich England and time zones which adds or subtracts hours depending on how far you are from the prime meridian. 

Mars  takes 24hrs 39mins 35s to rotate about its axis. There have been proposed time keeping schemes for Mars. The question now is how do you synchronize Earth and Mars time? Simple, carry a clock (again, corrected for time dilation) that tells the time on Earth. 

Let's use a different planet for a clearer example. Suppose we get the technology to explore and settle on Venus. Venus takes 116 days 18 hrs to complete a rotation about its axis. How do you keep time? Let's keep things simple and just ignore the 18hrs(lol). One way is to devise ""Venus hours"" which lasts for 1 day and say 001:00 venus hour is equal to 001 Earth day 00 Earth hours. And thus it goes a Venus day starts at 000:00 and 001:00 is simply 000:24. This system is exclusively relevant to Venus. Meaning if you're on Earth, you wouldn't care about it unless you have business on Venus. They will be independent of each other. Now to synchronize the clocks we simply bring a clock on a rocket and fly to Venus. Once we get there we adjust the clock to compensate for time dilation and match its equivalent on Earth. If the clock leaves on a rocket at Greenwich England (for simplicity) and arrives on Venus. You can use it to find out the time on different time zones on Earth. We can do this because while our time systems may be arbitrary as in we set 1 minute = 60s 1 hr = 60 mins, 1 Venus hour = 1 Earth day = 86400s and so on, as long as the base units used is seconds, because 1 second is still the same time as 1 second in another part of the galaxy...provided you compensate for time dilation either due to velocity relative to an observer or gravity.",1

"I did not, but now I do!   ""Sun \[light\] takes about 43 minutes to reach Jupiter. The return trip to the Earth can take from 35 to 52 minutes, depending on whether we are on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter or on the other side."" -  [https://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/astronomy-topics/light-as-a-cosmic-time-machine.html](https://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/astronomy-topics/light-as-a-cosmic-time-machine.html)

Seconds is an SI unit based on the decay of a cesium 133 atom and is independent of anything else. If we were to become interstellar/galactic then we would still use seconds. Then probably derive more convenient time keeping alternatives based on the definition of a second.,1

Indeed, you can use an app like Sky Safari to control a computerized ""GoTo"" telescope with the right gear. That's pretty advanced and expensive though, as far as I know, at least compared to a manually controlled telescope.

I bought the Orion XT8i telescope, but was disappointed with its ""push-to"" computer, so I just navigate manually. I find it more rewarding. But without stars, no way, that's almost impossible. That's the way you find objects manually. Only a computer could do that, although you typically need a few very bright stars in order to align it. Or get a scope with GPS (expensive I think).",1

"Alt-Az mount is basically just like a standard tripod so it keeps the telescope in the exact same orientation while the Earth rotates - so your image is also going to rotate.

The paper is mostly over my head, but I believe geometric albedos are found in the V column of Table 7. These are a bit different from the ones in the JPL list above. I couldn't guess all the reasons why.",1
"A second is: the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom"" (at a temperature of 0 K). Thats the current second and isn't Earth centric (except for its history). The second is our basic unit and there is no reason other than convenience to use days/weeks/months/years. Once you can measure those states of the atom you have computer that can track the millions of second since your time keeping started. 

Now defining which atom and how many periods for the basic unit is pretty arbitrary without some outside reference like the Earth's rotational and revolutionary periods.",1

"First of all, awesome capture, I really hope one day I can do something half as good as this :)

On the other hand... To what degree the rotation that we see is due to Jupiter's natural rotation and not to Earth's rotation? I know that Jupiter rotates crazy fast, but as the Earth rotates our point of view would change, which means we would look at Jupiter at a different angle every minute and therefore get a different image, wouldn't we?

Also, and this is some back-of-the-napkin calculation that could be awfully wrong, looking at the red spot it looks like it does about a third of a revolution in the period of the video, that OP has clocked at 2 hours. That roughly means a full revolution in 6 hours, while it is supposed to be about 10 hours. I know the precision of my calculations is very low, but still, the difference seems to be too big.

Thoughts?",1
Jupiter will be getting a speed ticket anytime soon.,1
We can actually directly image *some* planets now (it is still a new capability for large planets far from their stars) AND we can detect planets based on gravitational lensing which uses the light from a distant object (not the host star).  And yes these events are not sudden but we can tell a lot from the light from those stars and their distributions / dips in the light curves.,1

It's axis does not wobble. The tilt you see is due to the earth's rotation.,1

"Sorry for any confusion, the video is playing it in reverse half way through.",1
"Exactly, next year I'm going to add a wedge to that mount so that Jupiter stays fixed.",1
Am I seeing right. Does it rotate to the left and then to the right or is it that the video plays in reverse halfway through?,1
"This is because OP used an alt-azimuth mounted telescope, which does not follow the natural arc of the motion of the planets and stars as they move across the sky. The alt-az scope just stays at a fixed orientation, and thus as Jupiter moves across the sky, its angle *relative to the scope* changes. 

If Jupiter were tracked using an equatorial mount, then it would not appear to change angle through the animation (or if OP used a field de-rotator, but those are more hassle than they're worth).",1
"No prob, thanks.",1
Alright. I thought it didn’t make sense for it to wobble that fast but thanks for clarifying anyway 😅,1
You fixed it! Definitely better explanation. Thanks.,1
This. ISRO officially said that they had already found it (and are wondering what took NASA so long).,1
"Fantastic work, as always!",1
"So that my information on the imaging details don't get lost in the comments, I'm posting this again.

I kept my telescope pointed at Jupiter for 2 hours and 21 minutes and captured 174 frames. This animation was captured using an Alt-Az mount, so the Great Red Spot appears to rise from the southeast and then dips again once Jupiter passes through the meridian.

Check out my Instagram [@chucksastrophotography](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) for more of these kinds of captures.

This animation is running at 30 frames per second. It was captured in July, 2019 from my backyard.

"lol, maybe I didn't explain right.",1
It's so weird! I thought they would be in kind of a scattered configuration I wonder why they're in a train,1
Huh?,1
"These are good questions, I'd like to see what others think.",1
"We can't actually image planets from other star systems, only guess their existence based on light received from those stars. How were they able to guess that precisely 3 planets had been destroyed?

Also isn't this sort of catastrophic event something that takes place gradually, over a period of thousands or millions of years, and not suddenly?",1
"Depends on what's visible. I can usually work out the brightest stars even with lots of light pollution only because I'm aware of their relative positions during a season. I still get it wrong.

For trying to get something in the scope? That's different. I finally worked out a process that I've had success with using a tablet, my eye, telrad and finder. 

First, get Sky Safari. I've used other sky maps on Android, free and paid, but none of them had this very important feature--dynamic magnitude adjustment. What I mean by this is I can set the FoV to what I see when I look up, then set the lowest magnitude I can see naked eye. That closely resembles what I see in the sky. Makes finding easier. Then, and this is the unique part, if I zoom in, more stars appear as if I were looking through the scope. Other apps, the magnitude limit didn't change when zooming. 

Next, I set up the equipment display on Sky Safari which shows the FoV for my gear. I find my first guide star with my Telrad and star hop until I can't. Then I zoom in Sky Safari to my finder FoV and use it to guide my hops. Finally, I switch to my eye piece. 

I do this in awe of how the astronomers did it without tablets!",1
"If we could see the detail with our naked eye, what you see in the animation is how it would appear.  It appears to dip from the east and then when it crosses the meridian, appears to dip to the west side - only caused from our perspective on earth, not because because Jupiter is wobbling that fast.",1
"I will travel to ESO's observatory in Chile next month, I was going to take my telescope with me but I won't since there is literally huge telescopes mounted over there.",1
"Yup, Starlink. It's a bit surreal looking.",1
"It’s the spinning speed possibly tied to its nature as a gas planet? 

The reason why neutron stars are spinning so quickly is because in their collapse, the angular momentum stays the same. A smaller body with the same angular momentum as a larger one will spin faster. 

When whatever gas cloud that created Jupiter turned from a loose cloud into a more densely packed planet, its angular momentum would also have to stay the same, increasing the speed at which it rotates. Is that why Jupiter roasted so quickly and also why solids planets aren’t quite as fast in comparison, given they were created differently?",1
Does it appear to tilt because of our movement or does its axis actually wobble?,1
I’m planning to use it in January while I’m at a gazebo in Malaysia! My prime target for first light is the Winter Albireo in Canis Major,1

"Suppression pads are useful if you're on a vibration-prone surface, like a deck. And they're made exclusively for visual use - they have no function for astrophotography.

Manual tracking is easy with a scope like this, where you'll be under ~200x for most objects, and closer to ~100x for a good majority of the time. Manually locating objects is also half the fun for a lot of people, as it's a great way to become intimately familiar with the sky.

"I have always been fascinated by space, but there is a particular episode that made the difference in how interested I am in astronomy.

 A couple summers ago, I couldn't sleep one night, and I went out and started looking at the ski and tried recognizing some of them for the first time. 

It was August so from where I was I could see Saturn and Altair pretty distinctively. I remember them giving me a deep sense of security and grounding. That was the moment that made me go ""I need to learn more about this! I need a telescope!""",1
Oh man this is awesome. I was in the stargazing when I was a teenager and then I just grew out of it. I want to get into it again but don't want to commit too much money to something I might not stick with. Does anybody I have a telescope they would recommend on cheap side that is pretty decent?,1
Does the glow of the remnant has and dust come from the heat they still hold? They don’t seem like they would be lit by a star. Or is this through a filter of some kind?,1

"The biggest Dobsonian you can afford and carry.
A 10"" is beefy, but manageable for most people.
An 8"" is in the sweet spot for 'grab and go' IMO.",1
"Short answer: Both. Kind of.  

Long answer: Prominences are pretty chill most of the time. Disappearing after days or sometimes months. A prominence can also erupt. That's when they're not chill. One of two scenarios can now happen, either, it peaces out from the sun and travels into space as a coronal mass ejection, or it doesn't and falls back to the sun. Flares are often (but not always) accompanied by coronal mass ejections. [The Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) shows what can happen when these get particularly large.

Now on to the aurora. To cause an aurora, the simplest way to explain it is when charged and/or ionising particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere. These particles become trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and travel down the magnetic field lines (ie, towards the magnetic north pole), where they can ionise the atmosphere which is in turn seen glowing.

So, in summary, a CME (from a flare or erupting prominence) can cause aurorae.

Disclaimer: I don't know much about flares and CMEs, but I do know about prominences. Also, if you want, I can come back to this later and add sources. Although it'll just be from books that are lying around the office.",1

Hopefully not! I enjoyed the fun of a manual mount when I last went overseas for a gazebo and the scope definitely is a treasure to be kept for years,1
Was 600 USD during the Stellarvue Access blowout sale as they’re ending production of the line. Shipping was a bomb though but YMMV,1
"No need for suppression pads for visual, but you soon will be tired of manually follow the objects. Ideally you are going after a goto mount but at least a motorized one that can keep your object in the field of view for longer periods of time. But hey, it is a wonderful piece of equipment you have and be glad for it. Astronomy is a wonderful hobby and you are right in not rushing into expensive stuff, but step by step so congratulations again",1
How much was it?,1
Thanks a lot! Singapore isn’t really known for night skies but it’d be really handy for overseas trips!,1
It’s more of a grab-and-go visual setup so I’m considering a set of suppression pads rather than a computerised mount,1

"I know nothing of home telescopes, as much as I would love one, but I'm happy for anyone that loves looking at the cosmos. I get a kick out of seeing the ISS make its way across our night sky here in Christchurch. Even seeing a satellite or.., I'm sure you know what I'm on about. I hope you enjoy your new scope.",1
Do you have the specs?,1
Nice ya,1
"That looks similar to pics I've taken on my phone; and is probably ""zoomed"" (cropped). You're seeing digital pixelation/blur here, and it's larger in this image 'frame' than it would be in the eyepiece.

So in other words it would be smaller in the actual viewfinder to the eye, but also more 'sharp' if that makes sense.

You can take much better pics through the same telescope I'm guessing; just not with a phone. You'd need something with better sensors and control over settings. Usually better final pics come from taking many frames (like 30 or more) and then 'stacking' them using specialist software that creates a 'best version from all the input frames'.",1
Love this stuff. It's becoming so accessible to actually see and capture images of planets and other celestial objects from your backyard.,1
Beautiful ya,1
"Hi all, noob here, is this exactly what you would see with your eyes? I know it would depend on the telescope, I’m just wondering if taking a picture of it would dumb down the quality, and if so could someone explain why taking a picture of it would dumb down the quality...just trying to learn",1

I can get lost if there's a lot of stars.  I live in an area with moderate to high light pollution so I can see only the brightest of stars.  I went to the woods to watch the Perseids one year.  No light pollution at all. I could see the milky way and more stars I could count. Saw plenty of meteors too.,1

"**Solar minimum**

Solar minimum is the period of least solar activity in the 11 year solar cycle of the Sun. During this time, sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes, and often does not occur for days at a time.  The date of the minimum is described by a smoothed average over 12 months of sunspot activity, so identifying the date of the solar minimum usually can only happen 6 months after the minimum takes place. Solar minima is correlated with changes in climate.
