This is hands down the best Messier object[.](https://i.imgur.com/zackmdO.png) None of the other 109 objects can compare to the true beauty of these optical binary stars. I envy my comrades in the southern hemisphere, as once one has gazed upon M40, they will be disappointed by all other deep sky objects. [Even the nearby galaxies](https://i.imgur.com/yYlP4jk.jpg) are nothing compared to the awesome (in the biblical scene)  Messier #40. Captured on January 7th, 2020 from a bortle 7 zone.

Many start at wider focal lengths, ie &lt;20mm since widefield is the most forgiving.

For ISO, depends on the camera. You should find your [ideal ISO](http://dslr-astrophotography.com/iso-values-canon-cameras/) which will allow you the maximum dynamic range. For most cameras this is 800 or 1600. There is little reason to go beyond 3200 in most models since, for values above that, the camera is simply taking a lower ISO image and applying a stretch to both the signal and the noise (which you will often do as part of post processing anyway, so you gain nothing).

To mount the camera, find a [T-Ring](https://www.highpointscientific.com/telescope-accessories/astro-photography/camera-adapters/celestron-canon-eos-t-ring-for-35mm-slr-cameras-93419) wihch fits your camera model (the linked product is for Canon).

My work involves looking for a type of evolved star called an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star.  These things exist as an evolutionary phase of a star after several preceding stages.  The first of which is the main sequence (MS), during which hydrogen is converted into helium in the star's core via nuclear fusion processes.

Then after that there's the red giant branch (RGB) phase, during which the hydrogen to helium fusion takes place within a shell which surrounds the star's core, which is now nothing but the inert helium produced by the fusion of the MS phase.

Than after **that** there's the horizontal branch (HB) phase, when that inert helium core is subjected to enough heat and pressure (from all the nuclear fusion processes surrounding it) that it begins fusion itself, converting the helium into carbon, all while the shell of hydrogen to helium fusion continues around it.

AGB stars are next in the star's evolution, and happen as the helium-fusing core is exhausted, leaving inert carbon (and some oxygen), while helium to carbon continues in a shell around that, and hydrogen to helium fusion continues in a shell around *that*.

Basically, in the AGB star phase, the stellar structure becomes somewhat less stable and massive convection cells begin to dredge up the enriched products of the fusion events (mostly carbon and oxygen) from the star's core, bringing it to near the surface.  This is actually how the Universe produces the majority of its carbon and oxygen, both of which turn out to be pretty important for things like life on Earth.

Since the Spitzer Space Telescope is sensitive to infrared light, and since AGB stars emit predominantly infrared light, it's the best tool we have for finding AGB stars, particularly in external galaxies (i.e., *not* the Milky Way).

My project has been, succinctly, finding AGB stars in a nearby dwarf galaxy called NGC 6822.  This galaxy is interesting in part because its overall heavy-element enrichment (chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium on a periodic table) is quite low, which makes it a convenient accessible analog to the kinds of star-forming galaxies that populated the Universe many billions of years ago.  I want to understand better how AGB stars produce enriched elements like carbon and oxygen in early-Universe-like conditions.

As for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it's going to be an amazing machine.  It's also infrared-sensitive (like Spitzer), but will have a different mission profile.  In short, it and Spitzer will have a lot of overlap in terms of capabilities, but it won't be a direct successor.

For example, Spitzer is a relatively small spacecraft (the primary mirror is only 0.85 meters across), and so is fairly nimble.  This enabled it to survey large areas of space, but not to great depth.  James Webb has a primary mirror that's **huge** by comparison (6.5 meters), meaning it acquire images that are way deeper (and by ""deep"" I mean that it can detect fainter things).  But the trade off is that the spacecraft is the size of a tennis court, and so steering it will be like a boat by comparison.  This means that large-scale surveys are harder to do.

JWST will be amazing at getting detailed studies of faint and distant objects, while Spitzer was fantastic at getting large-scale pictures of relatively nearby objects.

Hope this helps!

This is a tracked/untracked combined pano. All shots were taken in rotational sequence facing the same direction so as to make for an accurate landscape. In other words, this shot would be possible in a single shot with a wider focal length lens, it would just be far less detailed and colorful. No crazy compositing or swapping the sky for a Milky Way facing a completely different direction here.

I used my h-alpha modified Nikon Z6 and Sigma 50mm f/1.4 to take this. I took the tracked shots for the stars at f/2.8, ISO 800, and 2 minutes each with a 50% overlap from one image to the next. After the tracked shot sequence finished, I took the foreground sequence to capture the detail on the landscape at f/1.6, ISO 800, 4 minutes each with the camera still on the tracker and pano head but not actually tracking.

I did initial adjustments in LR on each image, then sent the star and foreground panels in PTGui where they were stitched into each pano mosaic respectively. I exported the foreground mosaic into PS and the star mosaic into Pixinsight. From there, I performed adjustments to reduce the noise, color collaborate (kind of), reduce larger stars, as well as bring out more data in the Milky Way Core. After this, I brought the output file into PS where I stitched it together with the foreground untracked mosaic manually. I used masking to correct for a stitching discrepancy between the layers while performing additional adjustments to my liking to yield this final result.

Spitzer is an infrared-sensitive telescope, which means it has required significant cooling in order to operate properly (any extraneous heat interferes with the infrared light gathering).

A while back, the coolant on board ran out, as there was only a finite supply when it was launched.  This meant that the longest-wavelength infrared light was now no longer accessible, however it was still able to detect shorter-wavelength infrared light, so it's been operating in a ""warm"" mode ever since (a reduced overall utility, but still something at least).

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits around the Earth like the Space Shuttle, Spitzer orbits the Sun in an Earth-trailing orbit.  This allowed it to more easily remain cold, which is necessary for infrared imaging, but has the side effect of being impossible to go out and service it, like we've done with Hubble a few times.

Furthermore, its distance from Earth has been steadily increasing since it was launched, and maintaining a communication link to it as it gets closer to disappearing under the horizon (of the Sun, from the Earth's perspective) while still angling its solar panels to power the telescope has become increasingly difficult.

So bring all these factors together and the conclusion is that it's time to retire the spacecraft.  Turns out, most space-based observatories don't actually last that long.  Spitzer has been doing its job very well for a very long time.

The contradiction comes from how differently the two fields describe the universe. Relativity says the fabric is space-time is flat and uniform, while quantum says it’s rough and chaotic. An example is when you study a black hole. Using relativity gives you one answer, and using quantum gives you another. They don’t match each other, but they are both correct.

So bad that i's hard to focus on anything at high power and things look a bit blurry, but tolerable at low power. Also the mount shakes like a mofo if you touch it taking quite a bit of time to settle back down.

It's likely the reason why the son just abandoned the telescope at his dad's house in the basement was due out of frustration from the bad optics and mount. One more thing, the 20mm is standard, also comes with a 10mm, but like you said, it was missing it and the scope goes for $190 new online. You saved a whole $40.

The telescope could still be used, but it's best to upgrade as soon as you can. There are far better Telescopes for not much more. Usually people suggest a Dobsonian. A 6"" can go for about $350 but an 8"" for $500 is the best bang for the buck. Huge aperture for the money.

As for eyepieces, you're probably looking at the high end gear. Televue, Explore Scientific, Vixen Optics, ect... They all produce eyepieces for serious, advanced astronomers with fancier scopes.

If you look up ""Orion Sirius Eyepieces"" or ""Celestron Omni Eyepieces"" you will get cheaper, but still decent eyepieces. But seriously, upgrade as soon as possible, or even see if he would refund you. Probably not, but you can try. Practically got ripped off.

I know pop-sci often expresses things this way. But they're wrong for doing so, and should feel bad. ;-)

Real cosmologists don't do this. They speak of things in terms of what we see *right now*. Betelgeuse, for example, ""may go supernovae soon"". Not, ""it probably went supernova a few hundred years ago"".

That's for these reasons (that are really just different ways of saying the same thing):

1. Time and space are fundamentally intertwined. Einstein viewed it as one thing that can't be teased apart.
2. Causality travels no faster than the speed of light. It isn't meaningful to express an ""order of events"", when those events are in different inertial frames, and/or separated by interstellar distances. There's literally no way to prove that something happened to a remote object, in terms of what happened in our past here. (In other words, your claim - while fun - is literally baseless and unfalsifiable. Not even in a pedantic way.)
3. There's no such thing as ""Simultaneity"". Which would be a pedantic thing to say about events on Earth - because in everyday human life, simultaneity is very much a thing, to the limits of our perception - and in fact much of our life is deeply dependent on simultaneity being a reliable thing. (Or at least close enough.) But at interstellar distances, lack of the existence of simultaneity is very much a relevant - even critical - concept.
4. There is no privileged frame of reference.

The direct consequence of this, is that it's utterly meaningless to say ""when"" something happened, that far away, relative to our inertial frame. All we can meaningfully say, is how far it is away from us right now from our perspective (using parallax or other approximate yardsticks), and its apparent vector of motion relative to us - right now from our perspective. And we can only meaningfully talk about ""sequences of events"", in terms how they are observed from our perspective.

For example: For something traveling at the speed of light - say a photon - there is zero time or space in the direction of travel. More specifically, since the rest of the universe is moving at the speed of light relative to the photon, the universe is compressed in the direction of travel. So much, that at light speed, there is no length in the direction of travel at all. The entire universe is reachable instantly, from a photon's perspective.

Clearly, the perspective of a photon leaving Betelgeuse, and you on Earth, don't remotely agree. And there are infinite inertial frames of reference in between, and none of them (not even ours) is privileged. Now you can start to see why it is utterly meaningless to compare an event many light years away, with an event in our own past. (And even worse, to express it with the language of simultaneity.)

Another example: If you were to launch on a spaceship from Earth, and travel at a constant 1 G of acceleration, here is what would happen: From your perspective, the universe would very gradually contract and shift to blue in the direction of travel. You could circumnavigate the entire universe in your own lifetime. But by the time you returned home, there'd be no Earth. No sun. No Milky Way galaxy. No local group. Probably no galaxies at all, anywhere to be seen - and possibly not even any protons left. Knowing this already though (and knowing that even if Earth somehow still existed it would essentially be impossible to find), you might choose to continue rather than doing a 1G flip 'n burn. In which case, you could (seemingly) paradoxically accelerate at 1 G forever, without increasing your rate of fuel consumption, and without ever reaching light speed.

But from Earth's perspective, your ship would start to get shorter, redder, and gain mass. Eventually appearing to be headed towards infinite mass, and seemingly headed towards requiring infinite energy to continue accelerating.

So when someone - or some pop-sci publication - conflates distance in light years, with time in years...they're just flat wrong. You can't separate time from inertial frame of reference. (That is, if Special Relativity is a thing, which by now has an overwhelming body of observational and experimental support.)

As a talented photoastronomer (at minimum), I might hope you'll start popularizing this notion. It's not hard for laypeople to grasp. I've found that young children are particularly adept at understanding it. Maybe they haven't yet been rigidly programmed to expect ""simultaneity"" to exist? Who knows. But adults can ""get it"" too.

Here's another, more technical way of looking at it:

And another, cheesier but simpler way, with soothing music.

Captured on the 15th of January, this is the result of just over 1,5 hrs of exposure on this nebula. At a distance of 5.200 lightyears, this is one of the closer star forming regions, and is active with very hot, young stars in its core. The apparent ‘hole’ in the center of the nebula is the result of the young stars’ strong stellar winds, blowing away the nebula’s gases.

This process gets around the fact that no star tracking camera mount is perfect. A lot of people will then process photos in something like Photoshop to improve image quality.   

Minimum requirements are a sturdy, heavy tripod (wind is a hazard to clear long-exposure photographs) and a camera that allows you to control exposure time, ISO, and aperture and set focus to infinity (and have it stay there)

Life is better if you have some kind of star tracker (entry levels include things like these: [https://astrobackyard.com/star-tracker-astrophotography/](https://astrobackyard.com/star-tracker-astrophotography/)) or telescope mount; a lens with a wide aperture; and the ability to save RAW format images (JPG compressors in cameras suck at dealing with stars)

The rest works like regular photography.  Longer lenses mean smaller field of view which means more magnification when you show it on your screen, but are more expensive and require more stability (which here means better tracking) With a wide-field lens you can go without the star tracker and just take a lot of exposures, but this will require a lot of room on your data card.  A telescope is a specialized lens for astrophotography, and it improves things but is not obligatory.

 Of course, do this after properly centering your telescope on Polaris first. After that, point to the star you know, and look at the star's coordinates in some kind of astronomy software. 

Note the The RA, then quickly on your scope set the RA Setting circle to read the same number. It is now collimated to your time. The DEC usually is fixed in place since pointing true Celestial North should always be 0\* (360\*). If it's loose for though, same thing. Just turn it untill it's the same  coordinate as the software says.

Slightly less competitive ""R2"" grad school programs tend to be a bit more relaxed and low stress, which for me at least, seems more conducive to learning; I saw a lot more grad students rage quit the entire program from R1 departments than R2 departments.

The North America Nebula is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, close to Deneb. This size of this nebula is around 100 light years across and it's around 1,700 light years from Earth.

The remarkable shape of the nebula resembles that of the continent of North America, complete with a prominent Gulf of Mexico.

Living 20 minutes from downtown Detroit, light pollution is sever, I used narrowband filters to block it out.

Pleased to answer anything I can. I started with a simple dslr + lens on a little tracking motor that counters the earth's rotation allowing you to take long exposures, usually around 60 seconds. This really is all you need to get started in the hobby and is a great way of learning the basic techniques. A motor like the skyguider pro could cost around $500 CAD. I then graduated to a small telescope that I could attach my dslr to. Over time, I got various light pollution filters so I could image from my city backyard, special cameras that could help me more precisely align with the north  celestial pole so I could expose for longer, and a much more sturdier mount. This hobby could cost $500 or $5000 (or more) depending what you want to do with it. The basic process is that you line up your mount or motor with the north celestial pole and it starts rotating with the stars. I set my exposure length on my camera using an intervalometer which controls exposure length and how many images to take. Then I go inside and take it easy until I need to go and change my dslr battery. In the morning all those individual 3-minute long photos are stacked on top of each other to bring out the faintest details in extensive post processing in photoshop, so the 6 hours of filming is combined into a single image. It'sa lot of info in there, usually hundreds of MB's large. As far as walking noise and dithering it may sound like jargon haha. If you zoom in on the dark areas you'll see some streaking, that is walking noise. Dithering is a process where, if you have a capable camera and mount, the camera is shifted a few pixels between each exposure so the noise doesn't get sort of stacked as well so you're left with a cleaner picture. I'll tell you this my friend, I never in a million years imagined I'd be taking these kinds of photos, but it's become such a big part of my life and opened my eyes to what is up there when we look to the skies that I don't lnow where I'd be now without this hobby.

To increase R by 2% youbwould have. 0.02R + R = 1.02R.

0.2% is two tenths of one percent...  so I think you have a translational error in your work somewhere.

I used that in a formula to figure the radius of the circle.  I have a known radius for the sun at 432690 miles.  Between the radius measurement I had, and the actual radius of the sun I now had a conversion factor for any inch measurements in the paper to real miles.  I measured the height of the circle the plasma (I think it's plasma) made and the width at the end of the 2 second mark, which was pretty much the largest it got.  I tried to measure the middle of the plasma on one side, to the middle of the other.  I did the same measurement for the width of the circle the plasma made and averaged them.  I now had an average diameter of the plasma circle.  Diameter times pi gives me the circumference.  I'm in agreement that the plasma appears to make 3 revolutions in that two hours.   (although I think it may have made the 3 in the first 80% of the video.)  From there it's just a miles per hour conversion.   clearly a lot of room for error.

Note that the focal reducer adds another piece of glass to the imaging train, so more aberrations such as chromatic or vignetting will be present. 

The ST80 is actually a really nice scope, because it’s fast (f/5) and dirt cheaper Only issue is that it’s an achromatic refractor, so it’s colour correction isn’t that great. When imaging, you’ll notice that the stars will always appear purple, and some brighter objects like planets or the moon will show colour fringing.

Really, the entire process of setting it up.  Without a manual and only a low level understanding of mounts/scopes, I'm struggling.  The Alt-Az is ok but having to manually track gets frustrating and therefore off-putting to the point I don't even want to go out and mess with it.  The hope is the EQ mount will make it more enjoyable (once I understand how to use it) and less frustrating.  All the while putting me in a position to track and try out imaging once I gain some comfort with it.

 However, I am unsure what specifically you need help with. Polar alignment on equatorial Celestron mounts is largely the same across all models, so any “All Star Polar Align” tutorial would suffice.
The general procedure is to confirm the mount date, time, and that the mount is at index marks. It will then slew to 2 stars, have you center each of them, and then slew to up to 4 more stars for calibration where you do the same thing.

To polar align after this (as ASPA basically just tells you your polar alignment error), have the mount slew to a bright southern equatorial star, back out of all menus on the HC, go to Align &gt; Polar Align &gt; Align Mount and you will again have to re-center the star. The mount will again slew away from the star, but only based on the calculated error. From here you will need to use only the adjustment knobs for altitude/azimuth near the top of the tripod to physically fine-tune the polar alignment.

Running this process twice can confirm a good polar alignment, and you shouldn’t need more than 2 or 3 calibration stars.

I’d hate to burst your bubble, but chances are you probably don’t have the right equipment to take photos of deep space objects. You need a precise and accurate equatorial mount capable of holding a telescope, such as an Orion Sirius EQ-G or HEQ5 Pro, which retail for about $1000 USD. You’ll also need a DSLR camera or a cooled CCD camera, which can also be expensive. You generally need a budget of a couple thousand dollars to get started in astrophotography.

All is not lost though. Taking photos of the moon and planets can be done easily, with pretty much any telescope. You can even use your phones camera.

675,[],,Astrodymium,,,[],,,,text,t2_4gm144sq,False,True,[],"""The way that deep space astrophotography works is that you have a motorized equatorial mount aligned with how the Earth rotates. The mount is able to track any object in the night sky. Many long exposure images are taken, and combined using a method called image stacking, which significantly improves the quality of the final image.

Most astrophotographers use a monochrome camera because it gives them flexibility in recording the specific type of light they want.

In some pictures, special filters are used that isolate the very specific wavelength of light that gets emitted by various ionized gases. The most common filters are hydrogen, sulphur, and oxygen. Each gas gets mapped to either red, green, or blue. The end result is a false colour picture that has a large amount of contrast.

True colour photos are shot using regular red, green, and blue filters, or by using a normal colour camera.

The images can be taken over one night or several, it doesn't matter. The more total exposure time you have, the better quality the final image will be. This is why people spend tens of hours on a single image, to get a better result. It gets much more in-depth than this, but that's a basic overview of how people do this type of astrophotography (deep space astrophotography).""",,1579755805,{},ffb97qo,False,t3_esoayp,False,True,t3_esoayp,/r/Astronomy/comments/esoayp/i_have_a_question/ffb97qo/,1579755806,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,,

Only hundreds of millions of years into the initial formation of the system, the two suns have expanded from blueish A/B main sequence main stars into yellow giant stars, baking the surface of the planet. However because of its outer orbit, it was spared from being destroyed, but is still a totally inhospitable shorching wastleland.

Orbiting in a dusty disk of debris-like material around 1000 AU from two stars of Eta Carine is a planet that shouldn’t even exist at all. Both stars in Eta Carinae likely started out as blazing hot O-type main sequence stars, whose solar winds should have completely cleared away any additional material after formation and the possibility for planets. In addition, the primary star underwent a supernova-like eruption of gas. However somehow this planet, which is actually more akin to a small planetoid/asteroid, somehow has survived.

Total: 7.1 hours

***Calibration:***

* Darks: No darks
* Bias: 37
* Flats: 44

***Location:***

*  (Bortle 3) in Oakura NZ
* Taken over 4 nights from 15-18th January 2020


***Equipment:***

* SLR lens - Takumar 135mm F3.5
* Skywatcher Star Adventurer
* Sony A6000 (Unmodded)
* Intervalometer

***Processing Details:***

Stacked the 3 exposure lengths in DDS (2x drizzle)

Did small initial stretch

Blended the exposures to form HDR core

Used purple halo and DSO enhance using astronomy tools action set. 

Star reduction using select colour range - feather - minimum filter. Also desaturated them.

Removed colour gradient by making an extremely blurred image and subtracting it. 

More stretching, curve adjustment etc

Masked the nebulosity and boosted vibrancy and saturation.",,1579728141,{},ffa594m,True,t3_esi1wf,False,True,t3_esi1wf,/r/Astronomy/comments/esi1wf/i_took_an_image_of_orion_and_labeled_it_its_much/ffa594m/,1579728231,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,,

A good grip of HTML5, CSS, webGL, SVG, and Javascript is also very important because many observatory programs have web front-ends (or SPA front-ends) these days.

Obviously you end up learning a lot of things about FITS (the file format used in astronomy), FITS viewers, etc.

But most software of this type is custom designed because the instruments and devices we are interfacing to are all custom designed (and in many cases, the only such devices in the world).

There is some call for machine language - especially in RT (real-time) application work (things like adaptive optics, which have to deform mirrors in real-time).

As for experience - you pretty much just needed to be good at coding, debugging, and being very proactive (observatories are very expensive and mistakes may cost millions).

The more languages you know, the more applications you've written (even on your own), the more experience you have doing concept to delivery - the more they will want you.

Having math, physics, etc - is icing on the cake - but not necessary (unless you are gong into those specific fields where such knowledge is required - like orbital dynamics, etc).",,1579717240,{},ff9oef6,False,t3_esfdlk,False,True,t1_ff9mpa6,/r/Astronomy/comments/esfdlk/how_can_i_get_into_astrophysics_with_a_degree_in/ff9oef6/,1579717248,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,,

All major observatories are completely computer run... from the movement of the dome and scope, to the instruments that do the viewing.  It is all computers and in most cases, a ton of custom software.

Likewise, at NASA - there are a huge number of software opportunities.

I do not recommend going past a BS in CS.  Job experience is way more important.  It all comes down to how versatile you are (in knowledge), how much you have done (complete applications, etc), how you work in teams, or independently, how proactive you are, etc.

A BS in CS opens just about every field in science to you.

The Great Comet of 1843, formally designated C/1843 D1 and 1843 I, was a long-period comet which became very bright in March 1843 (it is also known as the Great March Comet). It was discovered on February 5, 1843 and rapidly brightened to become a great comet. It was a member of the Kreutz Sungrazers, a family of comets resulting from the breakup of a parent comet (X/1106 C1) into multiple fragments in about 1106. These comets pass extremely close to the surface of the Sun—within a few solar radii—and often become very bright as a result.

What the notes don't directly mention is one way they twisted arms to get donations.  There was a tremendous amount of public interest in this comet, which led to interest in astronomy in general.  Harvard said to their alums and other donors, ""It's a shame we don't have a world-class instrument to study astronomical phenomena like these.  Why, Yale has a sufficient telescope.  It's a real shame we don't.""  The Harvard-Yale rivalry has been going on quite a while.

Another story I've been told about this scope is that when it was commissioned, Harvard sent someone over to Merz and Mahler (the company which was commissioned) in Munich to examine the lens.  Merz and Mahler had orders to produce two of these lenses, and Harvard wanted to be sure they got the best one.  The inspector - I've forgotten who it was - examined the lenses and performed a number of tests on them, then etched his name along the side so Harvard could be sure the one delivered was the one which he'd inspected.

Someone defending the idea of flat earth may say that we don't see Morocco because of refraction. In reality, refraction minimizes de effect of the earth curvature, but we would need to measure the effect of refraction before we can use intervisibility to  prove/disprove flat earth theories.

This galaxy, known as Centaurus A recently had a small jet discovered in within it by a team of scientists in 2017! Initially, I had thought I had captured this jet, however, there are two ""outer jets"" for this galaxy, the one here is the brighter of the two and not more recently discovered. Shame! However, I ended up finding a 120+ hours exposure on this target by an amateur, and they still were unable to image the jet. Crazy to think just how much better scientific equipment is compared to what amateurs have available to us.

The Soul Nebula is an emission nebula located in Cassiopeia. Several small open clusters are embedded in the nebula: CR 34, 632, and 634 (in the head) and IC 1848 (in the body).

The object is more commonly called by the cluster designation IC 1848.

It's nickname probably stems from the fact that it is close by to the Heart Nebula.

With light pollution even worse now that snow is on the ground, I used narrowband filters to block it out. The Soul Nebula was captured and processed in the Hubble Palette.

At that time of the year the galactic core was not visible so I wanted to focus on this part of the Milky Way. The Carina and Lambda Centauri nebulas can be seen with the pink/red color and also the southern cross.

For more of my work check out [my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/gorilla_astro/) clear skies!

Located in the constellation Ursa major (big Dipper area) at 21 million light years away, m101 is a face on Galaxy with a lot to show

Discovered by Pierre Mechain on March 27th 1781. Later sent to Charles messier to verify its position and be included in the catalogue.

M101 spans a diameter of 170,000 light years. A large Galaxy indeed but still doesn't beat our home Galaxy which is 258,000 light years in diameter. However! M101 has estimated 1 trillion stars about twice as much as our home the milky way galaxy. Quite impressive indeed!

This Galaxy is asymmetrical due to the strong gravitational forces of it's neighboring galaxies. This causes many strong star forming regions in it's spiral arms. 
In dark skies this object is best seen in telescopes with apetures of 8+ inches, but don't let that stop you from using what equipment you have to view the cosmos with.

Pre-processing:

Checked for bad frames in Blink, registered and stacked in Deep sky stacker using kappa sigma clipping

Processing:

Processing mostly done in Pixinsight. First I combined three images, a stack of 10 minute exposures, 30 second exposures and 5 second exposures using the HDRComposition tool. This gives the image a higher dynamic range to work on the blown-out core. Cropped the image to get rid of artefacts from the dithering. Then used MultiscaleLinearTransform for reducing the noise in the linear stage. DBE for extracting the background, which was particularly difficult to get right with all the nebulosity everywhere! Histogram transformation tool used to stretch the image, going into the non-linear phase. HDRMultiscaleTransform tool used to bring out the core detail, also making the stars visible in the trapezium. Then I applied ACDNR to further reduce the noise and smooth out the dust lanes using a range mask. I created a clone of the image to use as a luminance mask, where I applied local histogram equalisation for bringing out more detail in the nebula and surrounding dust. I then created another range mask, used for bringing out the dust and darkening the background. This was done in multiple iterations to get it right. I used more iterations of curves adjustments and local histogram equalisation to further enhance the detail. Then I sharpened up the core. Then I took the image into Photoshop CS2 and ran some astronomy actions. Make stars smaller was applied to reduce the star size further, making the eyes more drawn to the dust as opposed to the stars. Less crunchy more fuzzy helps to give the image a more 3D feel, so it isn’t flat looking. Local contrast enhancement particularly helped the region between Orion and running man. Finally, I saved the image and rotated it to my liking.",,1579622783,{},ff6aa7q,True,t3_erwmb7,False,True,t3_erwmb7,/r/Astronomy/comments/erwmb7/m42_the_great_orion_nebula_in_hydrogen_alpha/ff6aa7q/,1579622785,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

Camera: Sony A7S (modified)

Lens: Rokinon 135mm f2.0

iOpton Star Tracker

**Acquisition**

 \~120 x 30 second images (about an hours worth of integration), ISO 6400, f2.8

**Processing** 

1 -.ARW files loaded into ACR for lens profile corrections and demosaicing then exported as 16-bit .TIFF files.  

2 - Images registered and stacked in PixInsight.

3. DynamicBackgroundExtraction.  

4 - Extracted R, G, and B channels from integrated result and linear fit the R and B channels to G. Re-combine the matched R, G, and B channels back into a color image. 

5 - Photometric Color Calibration to G2V star.  

6 - Histogram adjustments with both the HistogramTransformation and ArcsinHStretch tools. 

7 - Multiscale Median Transform to both RGBK and Luminance components of the image. 

8 - Morphological Transform to help de-bloat the stars a bit. 

9 - Imported to Photoshop for some final color tweaks using the CameraRaw filter",,1579567636,{},ff4n45q,True,t3_ermr98,False,True,t3_ermr98,/r/Astronomy/comments/ermr98/the_blue_horsehead_nebula_imaged_from_a_dark_sky/ff4n45q/,1579567637,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

&gt; The visible surface of Jupiter is divided into several bands parallel to the equator. There are two types of bands: lightly colored zones and relatively dark belts.[6] The wider Equatorial Zone (EZ) extends between latitudes of approximately 7°S to 7°N. Above and below the EZ, the North and South Equatorial belts (NEB and SEB) extend to 18°N and 18°S, respectively. Farther from the equator lie the North and South Tropical zones (NtrZ and STrZ).[6] The alternating pattern of belts and zones continues until the polar regions at approximately 50 degrees latitude, where their visible appearance becomes somewhat muted.[31] The basic belt-zone structure probably extends well towards the poles, reaching at least to 80° North or South.[6]

...

&gt; The Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows (winds), called jets. The eastward (prograde) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward (retrograde) jets mark the transition from belts to zones.[6] Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, wind shear in belts is cyclonic, while in zones it is anticyclonic.[22] The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100 m/s.[6] These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7–1 bar. The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets.[6] The vertical extent of jets is not known.

You can get an idea of this from this animation; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#/media/File%3APIA02863_-_Jupiter_surface_motion_animation.gif

&gt; Zones, belts and vortices on Jupiter. The wide equatorial zone is visible in the center surrounded by two dark equatorial belts (SEB and NEB). The large grayish-blue irregular ""hot spots"" at the northern edge of the white Equatorial Zone change over the course of time as they march eastward across the planet. The Great Red Spot is at the southern margin of the SEB. Strings of small storms rotate around northern-hemisphere ovals. Small, very bright features, possible lightning storms, appear quickly and randomly in turbulent regions. The smallest features visible at the equator are about 600 kilometers across. This 14-frame animation spans 24 Jovian days, or about 10 Earth days. The passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000. The occasional black spots in the image are moons of Jupiter getting into the field of view.

Or here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot#/media/File%3AJupiter_Great_Red_Spot_Animation.gif

&gt; The cyclic motion of the Great Red Spot, imaged by the Cassini spacecraft

Now how does the great red spots latitude fit into this?

&gt; Careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the Great Red Spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager fly-bys.[22] The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.[23] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about 432 km/h (268 mph), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[24] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[25]

&gt; The Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[26] Because Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10 degrees and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot of 9h 55m 42s.[27] Despite this, however, the spot has ""lapped"" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[28]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot

So, the tldr, it is confined to it's present longitude by an east to west jet to the north and by a west to east jet to it's south.

I don't know that I can totally explain it, but many of the bands and borders between different bands that we see on Jupiter are created by boundaries between high-speed winds that circle the planet at a certain latitude.

So anything like a storm that would try to cross those wind-bands would just be ripped to shreds.

You can see an animation of the movement of some of those bands here: [https://youtu.be/IMT56HweN2g](https://youtu.be/IMT56HweN2g)

One of the amazing/entertaining things you can watch if you follow Jupiter weather is what happens when say two blobs collided--do they merge, does one eat the other, etc.  Of course the ""blogs"" are all giant storms of one kind or another with high winds and other atmospheric effects going on, so you're basically watching two giant storms collide.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), known by sailors as the doldrums or the calms because of its monotonous, windless weather, is the area where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator, though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough, a usage more common in Australia and parts of Asia.

You are right. And actually our neighbor star is basically moving at the same speed as we are. Because the speed you mentioned is the speed we move relative to the galactic center, and out neighbor star is moving along with us. The real relative speed between us and our neighbor star is just a tiny fraction of 720,000km/h.    
  
Anyhow let's imagine we still would go at that crazy speed relative to it.   
  
Let's scale it down so that Proxima Centauri is 100m away from you. And when you now scale down that speed you mentioned accordingly you come to a speed of around 2 micrometers/ hour. So within one day you wouldn't move more than half the thickness of a human hair.

It consists of 135 frames across 2 hours. I originally captured 178 frames but the wind, bad seeing, and bad tracking caused me to throw away over 40 frames. I am still happy with the result and love watching it go.

several reasons:

\- if you're streaming through your telescope you're not looking through it (or taking pictures) unless you have a second telescope.

\- most streams would be just one view of the same small piece of sky for hour upon hour.

\- it needs extra equipment and network connection which might not be available at the telescope.

Cosmos Now is one of the few who does live stream their observing but it really isn't very exciting most of the time, more like relaxing backround.

Then using pixel math combination to create the RGB color space image.
Several Curves, colour saturations (in PI) and Selective color in PS to get the colours you see. 
Then this RGB color space image was made starless with starnet.

Then 2 rounds of LHE were applied to Ha image using a range mask that first targeted the bright regions and then the dark

Star reduction was then performed by using mophological erosion and a starnet starmask that was binarized and then covoluted.

Then I applied a new technique I have created that aims to remove small faint stars from the image. Because after star reduction an image may have lots of little reduced stars that make the background quite noisy.

The technique is as follows: 

Create star mask with starnet.
Binarize the starmask to remove the unwanted small stars. Dilate the remaining stars back to roughly original size if not a little bigger. Convolute this mask.
Now using a starless copy of the original image, apply this starmask to it. Then add the original image with stars back in with pixel math. Only those stars that conform to the starmask will be put back in. Any small stars lost in the binarize will fail to be added.


LRGB combination was then done with this edited Ha and the starless RGB color space image.

Further contrast curves and saturation was applied.
ACDNR on L with a inverted stretched luminance mask was then applied.

Ideally you'd want access to both.

Because of the tilt of the Earth the northern hemisphere has access to more galaxies to image or view (M31, M51, M81/M82, etc) compared to the south.

In contrast, the southern hemisphere is tilted more towards our galaxy, so there are a lot more nebulae to view there, and the milky way stretches across the entire sky instead of half of it being hidden by the horizon. The planets also go directly overhead in parts of Australia, so the viewing experience is significantly better than for people in the UK or Canada.

Well you have to have the right conditions to see them with the naked eye and as long as they're successful with their luminosity reductions they likely shouldn't be able to be seen at all by the naked eye. So while I can kind of see where you're coming from there, it doesn't seem like a one to one comparison since blocking a view is constant. But seems like a fair place to come from.

Honestly there aren't many laws for this space as of now. It's so new the book is pretty much being a few steps behind what's happening. NASA would be able to use anything publicly available so as long as it's public they don't need any special deals or treatment. I'm not sure what data you're referring to exactly but if someone would get first pick of being worked with NASA is almost certainly high on any list when it comes to data.

If you're talking about NASA using Starlink in general then certainly.

The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large telescope (ELT) that has become controversial due to its planned location on Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawaii, a mountain which is considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The TMT would become the largest visible-light telescope on Mauna Kea.Scientists have been considering ELTs since the mid 1980s. In 2000, astronomers considered the possibility of a telescope with a light-gathering mirror larger than 20 meters in diameter. The technology to build a mirror larger than 8.4 meters does not exist; instead scientists considered using either small segments that create one large mirror, or a grouping of larger 8-meter mirrors working as one unit.

1- There is no price yet.

2- [This conversation with Gwynne Shotwell](https://spacenews.com/spacex-plans-to-start-offering-starlink-broadband-services-in-2020/) SpaceX's president is the most we currently have to go on. Since the beginning the aim as been rural, under served, and the developing world. Having expensive costs won't get you anywhere with those demographics. Though I believe Hughes net the current satellite internet provider is over $200 a month for really awful internet since it's in GSO

&gt;The price point is also being studied. Shotwell said millions of people in the U.S. pay $80 per month to get “crappy service.” She didn’t say whether Starlink will cost more or less than $80 per month but suggested that would be a segment of the public the company would target as well as rural areas that currently have no connectivity.

So you have no basis for claiming it to be unaffordable.

&gt;even if modern ground based telescopes are generally far more capable than space telescopes

That doesn't mean that will always be true. Launching has always been expensive which helps lead to any satellite being expensive. Not the only factor but it's a major one. It's cheaper to launch than ever and it's also arguably easier to build a satellite than ever. There are multiple companies out there working on satellite buses to provide power and propulsion so they can use that as the foundation and focus on their science /objective. 

I'm not well versed in the quality of ground telescopes but I do know that regardless of Starlink there are many downsides to them. Weather and day night both being constant. You also have limited locations and get to deal with lovely things like what's happening in Hawaii. You don't have that in space. Given the funding there is no doubt many if not all types of telescopes can be better in space. For one thing they can be bigger. We're at a point where, especially if Starship hits remotely any of it's goals, we could assemble a space telescope larger than anything possible on the ground. Not to mention building constellations even if they're ""cheaper"" satellites but covering a wide area. Imagine the effective lens that we can create with anything like those satellites. That's some amazing science. Why would you not want that?

Ground based ones that are good have money put into them. The [Thirty Meter Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Meter_Telescope) is over 1 billion. For that money we could have space telescopes doing plenty of science just as well I'd wager. Certainly more than it is with the stopped construction. The James Webb is over 1 billion as well so there is still plenty of lessons to be learned other than throw money at it. I feel there is a good argument for smaller more affordable telescopes built in numbers. Also if private groups not just governments build them it won't be the same as where we are today. I'd love to see a comparison of investment into space telescopes vs ground telescopes overall.

You read at least some of my comment, I felt I made it clear that it seems to be an inevitability. Even if the US manages to stop any US company from doing it that's only going to delay it happening. Astronomers don't have power. It's short sighted to act like this isn't going to happen sooner or later.

What exactly?

SpaceX seems to be the only ones that give a shit. So how is hindering them doing anything for the cause of trying to give us the best sky for the circumstances?

I want this to be considered separate if at all possible. This is not trying to be argumentative but I'm genuinely curious. 

Is that such a bad thing? Is a world where you can regularly see satellites during viewings so awful?

Through an eye piece you'd see it for how long? Especially in conjunction with viewing time.

I think that attacking Starlink is a horrible idea for astronomy. I don't think that you can stop mega constellations only delay them. Even if you killed Starlink there are other in the pipe and even if you made it illegal in the US other countries like China will out them up eventually. 

I'd say we're lucky that SpaceX is getting to this space first, essentially, (One Web did have a single batch but before but that's all they have) Elon and SpaceX have made it clear they're going to work and find a way so the satellites hinder ground based astronomy as little as possible. It will take time to figure out but they have started.

Now imagine that Amazon's constellation gets up first or China's. Do you think that they would care or even acknowledge the problem? I seriously doubt they'd do much more than say ""sorry, not sorry"". If SpaceX can find something that works it can hopefully become a standard. Something that the other followers will have to match or copy which makes it increasingly likely that any further followers will also match or copy it even if they aren't bound by the US's laws like other countries.

So all in all I think that for the coming future and possibilities for the sky, we're in one of the best possible starting positions. Trying to hinder that because you don't like the direction the world is going in regards to space is foolish. Even if you are able to effectively kill it in the US, you're still only delaying it.

With SpaceX lowering the cost of getting to space, and aiming to continue lowering it, we could see a shift towards less ground telescopes and an increase of space based ones. No day night cycles :D Though I am not well versed in any advantages of ground based ones it does seem like radio telescopes shouldn't be effected by the luminosity of the constellations so there is that.

Yesterday evening he asked me what the prettiest planet in our solar system is. We first talked about how 'prettiest' means different things to different people, and there's no right or wrong answer. He said he thinks Saturn, with it's rings, is the prettiest. I told him that I thought the color of Uranus was special and awe inspiring.

It had to be done eventually, so here it is! The Eta Carinae Nebula! Being the biggest and brightest nebula, it always killed me to know that it was only visible in the Southern Hemisphere. What a treat this nebula is some absolutely fantastic structure throughout it in the form of HH objects, bok globules, dust pillars, etc.

Just such an interesting area that many people either don't know about or will never see just because of it being located in the southern hemisphere.

If we project the equator out into the sky (see [here](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Equatorial+Coordinate+System) for a diagram), then we can use the distance around this ""celestial equator"" as a coordinate, this is what we call right ascension. We need a zero point for this, so we use the vernal (march) equinox. This is the point where the sun passes directly over the equator in march (the sun also passes directly over the equator in September-the autumnal equinox).

The measurement for right ascension then starts at this point and follows the equator towards the east.

The same happens at the other end of the spectrum with M-dwarfs having a wide range of properties and then even smaller L and T dwarfs having very strange properties (and in fact making the transition from star to gas giant planet a very fuzzy one indeed). 

Stars at both extremes are not well understood as they're either difficult to find or rare (they also behave so differently from our Sun that we have little in the was of a physical basis to being modelling them).

The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects. It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention.The origin at the center of Earth means the coordinates are geocentric, that is, as seen from the centre of Earth as if it were transparent. The fundamental plane and the primary direction mean that the coordinate system, while aligned with Earth's equator and pole, does not rotate with the Earth, but remains relatively fixed against the background stars. A right-handed convention means that coordinates increase northward from and eastward around the fundamental plane.

Because Decadal Surveys like Astro2020 only really have any sway over US federal funding. The majority of money for TMT will come from outside the US and with the remainder being private money from the Universities of California. Astro2020 has no influence over these. The decadal cannot tell TMT to move, but it could state grant federal funding on the condition TMT moves elsewhere. It's quite unlikely though, as the point of the Decadal Surveys is to rank scientific priorities. 

&gt;Now we'll just let China, Chile and the Canary Islands lead and we will fall behind.

China is a member of TMT, the US government is not. TMT is an international observatory.

The real bad news for US astronomers would be if there is no federal investment in TMT or GMT. It would mean astronomers outside the limited number of partner institutions would have no right to apply for time on either. Their best chance would actually be applying for the European ELT. It would also mean TMT and GMT continue cash starved, in which case their capabilities and science will be reduced for years.

I just find it troubling that here is a perfect example of religion standing in the way of science and there being wide spread support of blocking the science.  If would be different if this land was a tribal reservation, but it's been the state's land for a long time.  The indigenous people should have worked to make this land a tribal reserve a long time ago if it was truly a religious location for them.

Before getting a *proper* job (/s) I was researching x-ray binary stars. I needed to understand the physics of stars, and needed good maths ability etc, but also needed supplementary skills: I needed to process large datasets and that meant decent competence in using analytical software, I also taught myself to code so I could create my own software to do the analysis I needed. 

A lot of (pretty much all) observational astro work depends on using observations in electromagnetic spectrum to test theories about things that are so far away there is no other way to figure stuff out. That means you need to understand the physics behind emission/absorption lines in spectra and deduce what they mean.

In my research group we also had a team who worked on astro instruments - e.g. designing/building the x-ray telescopes that get put up on satellites. Those guys needed to understand the astrophysics behind the need for the instruments, and needed the engineering skills for the design/build work. 

If you’re doing planetary astro work, you will need geological knowledge. 

So, yeah, it’s a “broad church”, there’s a common foundation of decent maths, knowledge of physics and wider relevant science, and experimental technique. After that there is specialist knowledge needed for the sub-field you’re in.

Rippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name. The red and blue colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes. The bright star AE Aurigae is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas. When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted. The blue region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively. The Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as IC 405, lies about 1500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of Auriga. One and a half degree East from the Flaming Star Nebula is located IC 410, a region of faint nebulosity surrounding the open star cluster NGC 1893. The cluster itself is small and located just below center, underneath the central dust region of the nebula. This nebula contains complex wisps of gas and is a beautiful target for astrophotography

    If you're most interested in finding any objects nearby I'd recommend you use SIMBAD: http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=grs+1009-45&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search and click on the ""query around"" button. You might have to fiddle with the radius depending on what you're looking for.

I'm not an x-ray expert, but I think x-ray sources are pretty rare, so if you're looking specifically for x-ray sources near Nova velorum 1993 I wouldn't count on finding any.

Your CDA query looks reasonable from just a first-pass standpoint, but I haven't actually used CDA.

If you want to download the data, you'll probably end up with .FITS files. The only program I know of that does a decent job reading those is SAOimage DS9, but its user interface is awful.

I’m going to go against the grain here and say that I think you hit the black point a little too hard in processing. 

Light pollution sucks and sometimes you’re forced to darken the image to get rid of it, I get it. I think if you work on your processing skills you will learn little tricks to process it out without having to up the black point.

Pixinsight is amazing but cost prohibitive for most people. I’m really intrigued by “Astro pixel processor”, it’s not super cheap but you can get a free 30 day trial. It seems way more intuitive than pixinsight. If you get a 1 year license it breaks down to $5 a month.

I would also HIGHLY recommend an intervalometer. That sucks you got scammed, but an intervalometer can be ordered directly from amazon for cheap so I wouldn’t worry about that happening in this case.

The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.

I captured it in a single night of imaging with a one shot color camera, separate Red, Green, Blue filters were not needed.

Follow me on Instagram [@chucksastrophotography](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) if you would like to see what's possible to be captured from our own backyard and to see what telescopes I use.

So I’m betting that’s the department you want, or at minimum you want to go find out who the undergrad adviser is in physics and schedule a meeting with them- the department should have a prof in charge of this. That person will be able to give you heaps of advice on McGill specifically, and have enough knowledge of all the majors to help you choose the right one for your interests. 

I mean, keep in mind these days astronomy is all physics just on a universal scale for our laboratory. Plenty of astronomers have a physics BSc (I do!), but if your passion lies in, say, astrochemistry you might want to do the physics and chem degree. Hope that makes sense.

Here's a sketch of it: http://www.deepskywatch.com/images/sketches/M-42-orion-nebula-sketch.jpg

You can see the four stars in the brighter core, but there's a whole bunch of nebulosity in that area to see.

I also recommend getting a couple pieces of equipment to really bring out the nebula (and other nebulae, like the Veil Nebula, M8, M20 etc)

1. [Get a 32mm GSO Plossl.](https://agenaastro.com/gso-32mm-plossl-eyepiece.html). Not expensive, and will give you a brighter view, and a wider true field of view than the 25mm plossl.

2. [Get a good quality O-III filter](https://agenaastro.com/televue-band-mate-1-25-oxygen-iii-filter-b2o-0125.html). Don't cheap out on these, the premium ones are worth it!

If you *really* want to see more, then you can upgrade to a 2"" eyepiece and filter:

1. [30mm GSO Superview (2"")](https://agenaastro.com/gso-30mm-superview-eyepiece.html). This gives an even wider true field of view and wider apparent field of view than the 32mm Plossl.

2. 2"" O-III filter. The downside is the cost gets much higher - goes up to $200. If you wanted to still get a good filter that won't break the bank, [the 2"" Orion Ultrablock](https://www.telescope.com/2-Orion-UltraBlock-Narrowband-Eyepiece-Filter/p/5657.uts) is a great value at just $89. It's not as good as a quality O-III, but it will definitely enhance the nebula quite bit.

""The way that *deep space* astrophotography works is that you have a motorized equatorial mount aligned with how the Earth rotates. The mount is able to track any object in the night sky. Many long exposure images are taken, and combined using a method called image stacking, which significantly improves the quality of the final image.

Most astrophotographers use a monochrome camera because it gives them flexibility in recording the specific type of light they want.

In *some* pictures, special filters are used that isolate the very specific wavelength of light that gets emitted by various ionized gases. The most common filters are hydrogen, sulphur, and oxygen. Each gas gets mapped to either red, green, or blue. The end result is a false colour picture that has a large amount of contrast.

True colour photos are shot using regular red, green, and blue filters, or by using a normal colour camera.

The images can be taken over one night or several, it doesn’t matter. The more *total* exposure time you have, the better quality the final image will be. This is why people spend tens of hours on a single image, to get a better result. It gets much more in-depth than this, but that’s a basic overview of how people do this type of astrophotography (deep space astrophotography).""",,1578784903,{},fdyyran,False,t3_en93g0,False,True,t1_fdyx1e6,/r/Astronomy/comments/en93g0/the_famous_pillars_of_creation_as_seen_through/fdyyran/,1578796170,3,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,1,,,[],

20 years ago I would have believed Elon Musk of I had heard that he was going to provide low-cost Internet to the hinterlands, but he seems to be getting a lot more full of himself.  Thar was that whole ""pedo guy"" spat in 2018 and he has this series of tunnel and hyperloop projects in California that I also know he talks of as being something that would help the masses, but they are massively expensive, so unless he has some kind of scheme for providing a quota of cheap tickets, it will never work, and the same thing would have to be done with the Starlink constellation, OR he would have to break with the current trend and actually try to run this without management taking 80% of the profits, like most people do.

What I'm getting at here is that if he really were going to do these noble things it might be worse the eyesore and astronomy issues, but how much do I trust this guy these days?  Not much.  If Musk wanted to be SUPER God-blessed-me famous he would use his megabucks to develop a truly black solar panel that was 30% efficient or something, and cover the things with that and fix two problems at once, and then make black cars that could partly recharge just by being out in the sun.

Popularized by the famous Hubble Space Telescope image, here are the Pillars of Creation with a wider view of the surroundings.

About 7000 light years distant, the pillars themselves in the middle are about 4-5 light years tall.   These formations were sculpted by stellar winds and gravity, then ionized to glow brightly by extreme radiation of the nearby stars.   This image showcases clouds of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. 

I captured this image with a telescope riding on a tracking mount to keep the target centered in the view.   I then took hundreds of photographs through specialized narrowband filters to isolate the elements.   It is mapped to a false color palette.  The true color of the nebula is a very monotone deep red.

As always, enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!

This is what you need to do ""lens projection"". You put the eyepiece inside the tube thing, then attach the tube to your camera where you normally attach a camera lense.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0140U9URO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_4PkgEbYW7N1N9

You'll also need a ""T-ring"" adapter so the tube thing with the eyepiece inside can attach to your camera. The T-rings are brand specific. I have a Canon, so I bought a random Canon T-rings adapter - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LABC2VW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_NTkgEbZDFY8PJ

Now, all this being said, I've been told by much more experienced people than me that using a Barlow lense instead of the eyepiece/eyepiece projection tube thing will get you a bit clearer picture. You attach the Barlow lense to the T-ring (you still need that). I have this Barlow lense and will be trying that next -  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008Y0TM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_fWkgEb7SAB7YX

I like that I have both options though, for when I want to zoom in more when using the camera than just the Barlow will allow.

Otherwise the Oberwerk LW 15x70 will give more brightness and can be handheld for a while. It has a generous field of view, and a large sweet spot. It also benefit from mounting.

Your 12x50 roof isn't phase coated so either of these Porros should be sharper and brigher(Porros doesn't need phase coating by design; roofs can only match Porros if they have phase coatings). Nikon makes a Monarch 16x56 roof that is phase coated, but that would be beyond your stated price range. Maybe you could look for a used one if you want that.  

There are various 20x80's, but the \~$100 ones are have low mechanical quality, and just barely usable optical quality.  Oberwerk LW 20x80's are decent for \~$200.  

Oberwerk Ultra series 15x70 are very good quality, both mechanical and optical, and $400. You do get what you pay for with these.

If you get a 12x50 roof with dielectric and phase coatings and ED objectives(Athlon Midas 12x50), it will be better, and can be had for $400.

I think your composition is very well timed, having part of the moon in shadow highlights crater detail and gives depth and shape of the image. Whereas a full moon, in my opinion is pretty flat and boring as nothing is in shade.

As far as the colours go, the the moon subtle is key, there isn't much colour on it anyway so you need to replicate that in your image by only having hints if the colours you see in the posted image, cut back on the saturation and you should see a more natural image.

Disclaimer: I am not an astronomer. 

The race around the black hole can be remarkably short: a few decades. (There was a beautiful video of the centre of the Milky Way a few weeks ago that showed a few stars going halfway around the black hole in tens of years)

During this period, if nothing else, you would expect the planet’s trajectory to change, become more elliptical, faster, or slower. Whatever it is, the planet’s climate will change massively, and possibly wipe out most life forms, making room for others.  

If you’re unlucky, could the planet be stolen by the black hole, and end up curving the black hole?

Your theories are probably riddled with mistakes and misconceptions that are only readily obvious to people with a formal education in the field. Maybe they've even been thought of before and gone through the gauntlet of academic peer review and been dismissed. Maybe they would violate the laws of thermodynamics. Your missing piece of paper probably isn't why they thought you were dumb.

Maybe they're not even that bad in a vacuum but there's no evidence base that makes engaging with it worthwhile. Say I have some theory about why lions preferentially hunt zebras instead of wildebeest. It would make sense to find out whether zebras are actually a lion's preferred prey beforehand, right?

Maybe you're just off-putting in the way you approach people with your ideas. Maybe it's a combination of all the above.

And who are these most people making groundbreaking discoveries without degrees? Galileo? The B.S. in its current form didn't exist while he was alive, but he was educated and taught at a university. The best example I can think of is probably Leeuwenhoek, but a lot's changed since the 17th century. Tesla was earning top marks at a university before he dropped out.

*****
&gt; For just the second time, scientists have used gravitational waves to detect the merger of two colliding neutron stars.

&gt; The neutron stars - which each cram roughly the mass of the Sun into a city-sized space - have a combined mass greater than any other pair of neutron stars ever observed.

&gt; According to a slide presented by Katerina Chatziioannou on Monday at the 235th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society, &amp;quot;The individual masses are consistent with neutron stars, but the pair of them is more massive than all known neutron star binaries.""

Maya II, a cluster in Andromeda, is the only known more massive cluster. The stars in the core of Omega Centauri, however, are extremely crowded, estimated to be around 0.1 light years away from each other on average. Omega Centauri is overall a 'one of a kind' cluster in several aspects, so much so that it is considered to possibly be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that once merged with the Milky Way.

Remember, however, that globular clusters are spherical structures, and therefore 150 light years refers to a spherical diameter.

Let's do some quick calculations with this for fun!

150 light years diameter means over 1.75 million cubic light years of volume are contained within the globular cluster sphere, which is quite substantial. Assuming a majority of intermediate mass, low mass and dwarf stars in the cluster (not a bad assumption to make, given its age is around 12 billion years), and taking the Sun's diameter (a low mass star) as an 'average stellar diameter' (Sun's diameter is 696,000km) for the 10 million stars, that gives us a TOTAL stellar volume of around 20.8 cubic light years of stars.

Approx. 1,767,146 cubic light years of cluster volume vs approx. 20.8 cubic light years of stellar volume - that means that  approx. 0.0012% of the cluster volume is actually occupied by stars.

10 million stars is a LOT, but 150 light years of spherical diameter makes for one hell of a sphere! :)

The job market is rather competitive, as the number of new PhDs granted each year has grown way faster than the number of new permanent positions. Also, you must be willing to relocate, not just to different cities but most likely to different countries as well. Not everyone enjoys this lifestyle. I don't want to discourage you, just give you a realistic view of how the situation is. Keep in mind that loving X and working in X are two very different things.

Despite what people seem to think, our modern society is built almost entirely on quick-paced trial-and-error. People forget that our current societal structure is very new, not just in terms of the universe but even in terms of human history. Just 200 years ago, we didn't have ANY of this, and we sure as hell didn't have the whole world's knowledge at our fingertips even as far back as a couple generations ago. For a long time, we had this expectation that our kids would go to school when it was convenient, but mostly help with family business/income. Then it became that kids were required to go to school 180 days a year so America could stay ahead, then they would go on to help their families. Then it became that kids would go to school 180 days a year and could help their families or go to college. Now we have this notion that kids must go to school 180 days a year for twelve years and they better know what they want to go to college for or else. But this structure is so new that the actual school system itself never had time to adjust. So most kids go through school with no idea what career paths exist because they've spent twelve years memorizing Chinese dynasties, how to solve for x on an imaginary line they don't understand, and that if they don't know the answer to guess ""c"". We see this because the number of people who switch majors in college, or just give up and drop out when they don't like what they thought they wanted, is astronomical *badumtiss*.

I think it's entirely fair to say a large portion of the population never finds their niche because of how the school system works, and a large portion that do find it one day don't find it until later in life. And that's perfectly okay. Life isn't about these weird capitalist ideologies. You don't exist to surpass people and make tons of money to spend on tons of stuff. Life's a beautiful thing we are just meant to enjoy while we have it.

I would 100% recommend using your GI bill to go back to school if astronomy feels like it fills a...space...in your life. (Sorry I'll stop with the puns.) A lot of people will argue that it's a waste of time because of your age but it's not. Science is about expanding human knowledge, so as long as you have a functioning brain and can find ways to contribute, by all means do, whether you're a 10 year old prodigy, an 80 year old late bloomer, or somewhere in between. The more minds working in a problem, the more viewpoints it gets, making the chances of solving it higher.

However, I do have to make you aware of the realities. 1) You will need to make sure you can afford to....yk....exist while you're in school. Don't forget to find a way to cover expenses before diving in and don't bite off more classes at a time than your time/expense allotment can handle. 2) You will need a ph.d. in astronomy for a good research position, which means you'll about 50. If you're good with that, awesome, if not, maybe reconsider. 3) It will initially be hard to get a job in the field, especially at 50. Fortunately, because to get a ph.d. requires basically a research assistant type position, it wont be a HUGE hindrance. But it will be a hindrance nonetheless. 4) I would strongly advise a double major with physics if you do astronomy. You'll have way more options in the job field. 5) You 100% have to be okay with a lot of math. i would run through khan academy and maybe some edx archived/self-paced courses to catch up if you're not up to a calculus 1 understanding before enrolling or you will fall behind fast.

\-EQ3 mount with added dual-axis motors

\-No auto-guiding whatsoever, just the telescope and my old unmodified Canon 1300D camera that had some damage done to its sensor beforehand

\-No filters were used

\-I can't expose for more than 30 seconds on my camera I took:

\~150x30""@ISO800 (50 bias frames, 40 darks, and no flats)

\~200x30""@ISO1600 (50 bias frames, 30 darks, and 50 flats)

Total integrated exposure time= 3 hours

Unfortunately, my lack of equipment forces me to stand right next to the telescope at them freezing temperatures and press the shutter button on the camera every few minutes.

Guiding is the use of a small telescope or device 
called an off axis guide which takes light from the main scope, and a small camera to capture any small errors in the mount (e.g. imperfections in the gears or motor, not so perfect polar alignment, light wind, poor balance, etc), and then sends a signal to the mount in order to correct it. 

But tracking is when you have a motor which has a shaft that is aligned to the celestial pole and rotates at the speed of Earth’s rotation. You need tracking, but guiding isn’t essential (though still very helpful).",,1578408501,{},fdguatf,False,t3_el8r2n,False,True,t1_fdgk9f1,/r/Astronomy/comments/el8r2n/i_imaged_the_omega_centauri_globular_cluster_at/fdguatf/,1578441936,2,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The moon and planets will have ugly colour fringing around them, and the brighter stars will appear purple. The mount will also shake for numerous seconds when you even just slightly touch the focuser, or a light gust of wind blows in your direction. This is more prominent the higher you set the tripod up. These kinds of scopes are called hobby killers, because they’re just so frustrating to use and you’d likely lose interest in the hobby.

You’d be much better off with a dobsonian telescope, which although is a bit more expensive, will be so much better in the long run and can last you much longer than what that puny 70mm refractor can offer. 

Dobsonians are basically reflector telescopes mounted on a sturdy wooden base. Technically refractors will offer better views, but in the lower end range, reflectors will always outperform cheap refractors. 

Depending on your budget, there are a wide range of dobsonians available. The standard recommendation would be an 8” dobsonian by either Apertura, Skywatcher, or Orion. They sell for about $400-450 USD, but it’s better to get the Apertura because it comes with better/more accessories and is worth the price difference. But optically, they’re pretty much the same. Worldwide the Apertura is sold by many different names such as GSO Deluxe, Bintel, or Astornz.

The best recommendation would be a 6” dob, but there are less options available so you’ll have to get one either by Skywatcher or Orion. The two actually come from the same factory, so it doesn’t matter which one you get. But the Skywatcher comes with more accessories. They sell for about $300USD.

There are also cheaper options like the AWB OneSky or Skywatcher Herirage for $200USD, or the Orion Skyscanner for $100, but they obviously don’t show as much as the above versions. You really get what you pay for.

If $100 is out of your scope (pun intended), then you’d be better off with a good pair of binoculars.

There are still other independent measurements that point to an accelerated universe. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/el5mtd/new_evidence_shows_that_the_key_assumption_made/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) for a discussion.

&gt;Are we looking at a closed universe then?

That would depend on the 'new' matter content, if it needs adjusting. Basically the energy density of matter + dark energy - curvature (converted to units of energy) has to be equal to one. Right now we think matter = 0.3 (30%) and dark energy = 0.7 (70%), making the curvature 0. If we just get rid of the dark energy and leave matter at 30%, then the curvature becomes -0.7 which would mean a hyperbolic (open) geometry. A positive contribution of curvature would mean it's closed.

However, the curvature has been independently measured to be very close to zero, so in order to get rid of dark energy, the matter energy contribution would have to be very close to 1.",,1578385430,{},fdg9724,False,t3_el22xo,False,True,t1_fdfl7an,/r/Astronomy/comments/el22xo/new_evidence_shows_that_the_key_assumption_made/fdg9724/,1578429793,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

However, the brand doesn’t matter too much because there’s really only two telescope manufacturers in the low end range of astronomy - Synta and GSO.

I’d personally recommend the Apertura AD8, which retails for about $450USD. There are cheaper options such as the Orion XT8 or the Skywatcher Skyline 200P, but the Apertura comes with much better accessories, and are definitely worth the extra $50 or so. It’ll be cheaper in the long run anyways.

If the 8” is too expensive, you could get a 6” version for about $300USD which is still a great scope, but won’t show as much as the 8”, as aperture is king in visual astronomy. There’s not many 6” dobs in the market, so just get something like a Skywatcher Skyliner 150P or Orion XT6, though I’d recommend the former because it has better accessories, though not as good as the Apertura.

If the 6” is still too expensive, then your only option would be a 5” tabletop dobsonian such as the AWB OneSky or Skywatcher Heritage 130P (both the exact same thing, but the AWB is only available in the US), which sell for about $200USD. I have one of them and they’re pretty nice, though you will need something sturdy to put them on. I use a milk crate to put the scope on. and a chair from the dining table for me to sit on.

If $200 is out of your realm, then you’ll have to either look through your classifieds to find a used dobsonian, or buy binoculars. 95% of telescopes under $200 are either literal junk, or just too small that you’ll get bored very quickly. A $100 pair of binoculars will likely outperform a $100 scope, and you have the benefit of a wide FOV, which will be great for learning the night sky. You can also use binoculars even if you upgrade to a proper telescope.

Avoid Celestron Powerseekers (r/dontbuyapowerseeker) and GoTo telescopes, because cheaper GoTo telescopes will have a tiny scope because the electronics are expensive so not much of the budget goes to the optics, and GoTo doesn’t make things easier - it often complicates everything to the point some people quit because they hated having to do so much setup, even if they just want to do a quick observation session.

However a degree or two at -3 or so will only make a slight difference. It would make much more difference at  around +15 degrees C and almost no difference at -15 C. The exact effect will depend on the camera - it's useful to make a graph of dark current with temperature so you can estimate the effect:

[http://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/images/signaltonoisefigure2.jpg](http://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/images/signaltonoisefigure2.jpg)

(you could use a plot like that to scale your dark frame but for that small a difference it's probably not worth it).

To answer your second question, ideally yes, you should take dark frames either side of your light frames at the same temperature for best results, but of course that eats into light exposure time, so again, is it worth it? Probably not unless the temperature is really varying a lot. A peltier cooled camera with temperature stabilisation is the best solution.

PS a bias frame is not the same thing as dark frame, a bias frame is taken with zero (or as close to zero as possible) integration time and gives the 'zero point' of the signal on the chip, hence it is also sometimes called a zero frame. The zero point does not vary with integration time and ideally should not vary with temperature. 

The dark frame gives the dark (thermal) signal and will accumulate with integration time and increase with temperature.",,1578343641,{},fdep1mb,False,t3_ekzjzk,False,True,t3_ekzjzk,/r/Astronomy/comments/ekzjzk/what_happens_if_my_master_bias_frame_was_shot_at/fdep1mb/,1578398696,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The Heart Nebula lies some 7500 light years away from Earth and is located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by William Herschel on 3 November 1787. It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.

The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896 and known as the Fish Head Nebula, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. The nebula's intense red output and its morphology are driven by the radiation emanating from a small group of stars near the nebula's center. This open cluster of stars at the Heart's heart, known as Melotte 15, contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction of our Sun's mass.

I’ve actually checked Astrobackyard and a few others, but as they sometimes give really different advices about the post-processing, I was unsure of which tuto I had to stick with. I couldn’t do much anyways without a reflex camera or other fitting imaging devices. I’ve just been able to get a short movie of Jupiter and a few moons with the GPCam but didn’t know what to do with it as I probably messed up the parameters, and it was quite blurry even when I tried to stack it. Felt a bit discouraged, and as I lacked free time, I delayed my apprenticeship for longer holidays.

I’m using a Maksutov-Cassegrain 127/1500 from Skywatcher! Wanted something compact and versatile that I could eventually bring with me, hence the choice of the AZ-EQ 5 pro mount which is moderately lightweight. I’ve been using it for a while now, doing planetary observation, but I still had astrophotography in mind so I made sure that gear could fit for a beginner in this domain. Got motivated with your pics and message, so I’ve just found a second hand Canon D1000 to complete the kit and make a good start!

And yeah, space is fascinating. I’ve always wanted to connect further with it. I made it my studies, but when I wanted to make it a hobby as well, the required gear costed a lot for a student. Observation is awesome, but astrophotography can show you so much more. After all, our eyes are imperfect instruments with a narrow spectrum. Finally could save up enough to invest in a setup that should last for a few years. I just have to find the time, and hop on the train, hahah. 

I’ll check out everything you listed there when my camera will be shipped, and hopefully I’ll be able to show pictures that’ll be half as good as yours after enough experience!

This target is officially known as Sh2-308, but I have always enjoyed the Dolphin Nebula.

I also used this somewhat old, but very handy dandy [site](http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/astro/HR-temp-mass-table-byhrclass.html) for the RGB colors, and bassically I took the subdivisions for each spectral type and looked up the mass (ie. ussually an average main sequence star below with a spectral type later than O8V will have had an inital mass somewhere below 25 solar masses, whereas an average main sequence star with a spectral type above O8V, will have initally formed with a mass somewhere above 25 solar masses), then took all those subtypes in the certain mass ranges, averaged each of the red green and blue values for RGB and used that average number for the average color of each star in the mass range. I had to do some guestimating with the red supergiant sizes, since red supergiants are stars that have lost of a lot of mass and thus they ussually range from 10-20 solar masses, but I think I have a somewhat good aproximation of the general sizes. This chart is also somewhat simplified, because there can be some cases where stars with inital masses 30-40 times the mass of the sun can go from RSG to WR, and stellar evolution can also depend of metalicity, but for the sake of simplicity and not losing my sanity in not being able to find a good source, I decided to leave a lot of that stuff out.

Because I am planning to include low mass stars similar to our sun and really low mass stars like red dwarfs, its going to be a bit of a challenge, because what I have done so far is to scale, but at true scale, you couldnt even see the sun, let alone a star 1/0th the size of it.

Humans have found better communication methods that don't require blasting radio waves into empty space; presumably if any intelligent species exist then they also have stopped transmitting randomly into the cosmo, and listening for radio signals from distant aliens is a bit like trying to start a game of Marco Polo in a pool full of Deaf people: they don't know we're trying to get their attention so they don't know to look for a signal they normally wouldn't even detect.

However the one I kind of hope is true is that we are among the first intelligent species to evolve, and so we're just early to the party. There's something deeply romantic to me about it. We find a universe that seems cold and alone. We explore and settle the galaxy and still nothing. Then, suddenly, intelligent life, but at an earlier stage of our development. They're trying to build a society in a universe that seems cold and indifferent. They are alone, like we were. So we decide to go to them. We tell them ""we were alone, like you. We can be together now. We will teach you how to fly across the stars and settle planets, and how to avoid the mistakes we made. You will teach us, for there is so much we don't yet know. We'll find more like us, and then we'll go and meet them, together, and assure them that they are not alone. Because we were alone, and we struggled and suffered wondering if anyone in the universe cared, or was capable of caring. We called out, but no one answered; we choose to answer: 'we are here, we are like you, you are not alone.'""

Black holes are still pretty much guaranteed to be necessary in galaxy formations, but there are theoretical ways for black holes to leave their nest, so to speak.

One would be another black hole coming in for the merge from an unfortunate angle, causing the resulting gravitational wave to kick the entire thing out of its galaxy.

This app is one of the coolest things I have seen lately.

Many times I have considered building by myself one solar system to scale, however it’s difficult to fulfill a compromise between planets sizes and distances between planets.

With your AR application that’s easy to do. So I would recommend some suggestion of upgrades/improvements:

1. Allow the arbitrary solar system scale the user decides to use. For example you can decide to make a 4km solar system, and the user would hike with kids/friends to find out were planets are. Doable using GPS function.

2. Opposite: decide the size of any given planet in centimeters/inches, and rebuild the solar system accordingly.   

3. Show orbit paths.

4. Add double stars systems also to scale.

5. Add exoplanets, there are plenty of databases around.

6. Implement in iOS

Anyway, this is a cool application. Congratulations!!!",,1578221727,{},fd8q6tp,False,t3_ek2qss,False,False,t3_ek2qss,/r/Astronomy/comments/ek2qss/updated_exploar_solar_system_app_now_it_has/fd8q6tp/,1578300753,12,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The Whale Galaxy (NGC 4631) is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. This galaxy's slightly distorted wedge shape gives it the appearance of a herring or a whale. This galaxy is seen edge-on from Earth.

The Hockey Stick Galaxy (NGC 4656) is a highly warped barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici and is sometimes informally called the Hockey Stick Galaxy or the Crowbar Galaxy. This unusual shape is thought to be due to an interaction between nearby galaxies including the Whale Galaxy.

They were captured from my home just 20 minutes away from downtown Detroit.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Two large observatories were built in the United States with the aim of detecting gravitational waves by laser interferometry. These can detect a change in the 4 km mirror spacing of less than a ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton.The initial LIGO observatories were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and were conceived, built and are operated by Caltech and MIT. They collected data from 2002 to 2010 but no gravitational waves were detected.

The Advanced LIGO Project to enhance the original LIGO detectors began in 2008 and continues to be supported by the NSF, with important contributions from the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Max Planck Society of Germany, and the Australian Research Council.

First OP's clip with the hubble picture and the sound. All that is just a computer going ""oh this is bright and dense, I'll make this tone for galaxies that are this bright and this dense.  Oh this is dim and diffuse, I'll make a different tone for galaxies that are this dim and diffuse.""   The tones are not a representation of actual galaxy size or amount of radiation or anything like that.  Just brightness and density of things it sees in the picture basically


Second, I was replying to someone who was asking a question they *thought* was related to OP's post but was actually completely unrelated.  So you are absolutely correct about the difficulty and rarity of gravitational wave detection and when I mentioned using computers to detect gravitational waves I was simplifying the explanation so not to befuddled the person I was replying to anymore than they already were by getting into LIGO and how the waves are detected.

Not sure if you want info directly related to gravitational wave detection or just astronomy in general but if you're interested in this kind of stuff I highly recommend these channels.  They almost always post sources from their research in the description so you can end up going down some really awesome rabbit holes if you get the itch:

1.) Anton Petrov gives almost daily updates regarding new findings and research: 
https://www.youtube.com/whatdamath

2.) John Michael Godier is a science fiction author and on his channel he not only goes into the actual science but also into theory.  He interviews astrophysicists and people in the field too (also I like his voice) 
https://www.youtube.com/johnmichaelgodier

3.) SEA doesn't publish daily videos on his main channel but what he lacks in quantity he more than makes up for in quality. 
https://www.youtube.com/sea1997

Those are some of my favorites off the top of my head.  Again, check the description for sources if you're looking for something to read instead of just watch, there's some pretty amazing stuff.

Gotta throw these guys in here just because they're so damn informative and help to understand some of the chemistry that pops up in Astronomy.

But isnt it true that gravitational waves are hard to detect.

Im not well informed about them being detected and recorded to an extent where they can be used for converting them to sound waves using computers.

 But a good thing to remember is that just because you're seeing something in this picture that looks tiny it could just be something really really big, just farther away. 

 A big fat looking galaxy you can see easily in this picture may actually be far smaller in reality than one of the tiny dots because one of the tiny dots may be an even bigger huge galaxy, just farther away so it looks small.

Like the moon looks like the biggest thing in the sky because it's close but in reality it's far far smaller than all the stars you see around it in the night sky.

TL;DR

**In very basic terms here's three things to know:**

1.) there is no sound in space

2.) black holes don't suck in gravity

3.) black holes, especially colliding black holes, make huge gravity waves. 

Since there is no sound to hear we instead use computers to detect gravitational waves.  Those waves are converted by a computer into sounds that our ears can hear since we can't hear gravity with our ears.  Hope that helps!

**Edit: in the case of OPs post they're really only using image density info to create sounds.

The astronomical system of units, formerly called the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, is a system of measurement developed for use in astronomy. It was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 via Resolution No. 1, and has been significantly updated in 1994 and 2009 (see astronomical constant).

The system was developed because of the difficulties in measuring and expressing astronomical data in International System of Units (SI units).

its not that bad, really. its not too hard to set up and also not that time consuming. Its usually the opposite - you have to hope for clear skies and ideally no moon.

I had a DSLR to begin with. I got the telescope new and the mount was second hand bought. I guess 2k euros, maybe a bit less. But its possible to start out with a lot less. I've started taking milkyway-shots with a DSLR and standard lenses which could get you going at about 300€ used.

To mount a DSLR to it, you'll need a T-ring adapter and another adapter specific to the 5se, which I can't remember the name of. If you're at all thinking about progressing towards astrophotography of any kind, then I can't really recomend this scope. The mount just isn't up to the job for long exposure astrophotography. In the long run, it would be a better option to go for a nice equitorial mount.

But as I said, for planetary work it's good. The mount can however be a little shaky at times, which can knock the OTA out of view sometimes.

I've put a link on ours to like and follow our FB page and it gets hundreds of hits a month and is a great way to post upcoming club events and activities. Here's our website https://www.centexastronomy.org

Also NASA has lots of public outreach resources and you can get lots of free stuff that can be used for educational outreach. The Night Sky Network is also good too.  

Having public events in high traffic areas like parks, movie theaters, or malls is also good. Due to the light pollution, hold these types of events when the moon is up as it's a great crowd pleaser especially during first quarter moon. Be sure to have a booth set up with info about the club and new member forms folks can fill out to join on the spot if they wish.  Also take advantage of any city wide events where vendors can set up booths like public concerts, etc. You'll prolly have to pay a fee to setup a booth but it will be worth it to show off the club to the public. You can set up scopes to look at the sun during these kinds of events. 

Hit up your local community college and talk to the science professors there (especially if they have an astronomy 101 class) and let them know your club exists and ask if there is anything your club can do to help out or offer to invite the class to your observatory for a special project the class might be able to do (some exoplanet observations can be done with surprisingly basic telescopic equipment). 

So now you have lots of new members with all this work you've done.  How are you going to keep them engaged within the club to ensure they stick around?

Sure, star trackers are excellent for astrophotography, especially with telephoto lenses! 

So, advice:

1. Polar alignment is key - With a star tracker and a telephoto lens, you'll want to make sure that your polar alignment is spot on. The better you get it, the better your images will be. You'll be able to expose for longer without field rotation and life will become easier. 
2. Integration, integration, integration! - Your integration time is so important for bringing up that signal to noise ratio. A DSLR is generally quite noisy, so you really need to hammer down some hours on all your images. I'm talking at least 2 or more hours for each image. Yes, you can definitly get something out of an hour or less, especially at a dark sky or with a fast lens. But processing will be that much easier with more time and you'll be able to bring out that much more detail, that much more colour and you'll be that much more happy with your image. 
3. Planning! - before beginning any session, make sure you have a plan for what you want to do! Going in without a plan, no idea what you want to image or what you're going to do can waste precious clear sky time - especially here in the UK! Choose a target before hand and make sure your equipment is ready. Get it balanced, aligned and take it out before it gets dark. Check your batteries are charged and everything is working beforehand. There's nothing worse than realising something is wrong after you've set everything up. 
4. And 4, make sure to enjoy the ride! - This hobby can get frustrating sometimes, even demoralising. But just know, that whatever problems you face can be sorted with persistence and enthusiasm. The night sky ain't going anywhere anytime soon, so take your time with the hobby and most importantly, enjoy it for what it is! 

And yes, for sure you could get a great picture of Andromeda with that gear! It's a massive target. I took a decent picture of it with a 200mm telephoto when I was first starting out, which was bewildering to me!

Yeah, the altair GPCAMs are really designed for guiding or lucky imaging for planetary or even galaxies. What telescope OTA are you using currently?

Sure! I learned a lot of stuff alone from a YouTube channel called Astrobackyard. He does lots of tutorials and vlogs with technical details in them as well. He also has a website that hosts lots of informative information such as reviews, guides and galleries. Chuck's astrophotography is another great channel if you're into deep sky imaging with a dedicated mono camera. He provides all his technical details, which is really helpful for beginners who don't know what settings to use. Astrofarsography is a channel similar to astrobackyard, who uses a DSLR/CMOS for imaging and provides some good tutorials and vlogs. Dylan O'Donnel is another great watch, as he goes more into the technicalities of the cameras and the process behind his images (He's also pretty funny). Astroaddict is another channel that posts mainly vlogs and some tutorials, he has some great content as well. VisibleDark Astrophotography is a channel I discovered recently and he creates some excellent processing videos using pixinsight. He also delves deeply into his images, creates comparisons and all around has a great YouTube channel. David Aldrich is another good source for pixinsight processing, as he as an entire series just for processing. 

There's even more channels out there that I've probably forgotten to mention or have never seen before. But YouTube is a great place to go to for well put together, concise information. 

And one brilliant book I recomend is 'Making Every Photon Count'. This is a great book for beginners and really gives an insight to the hobby. It can also help you save money in the long run, since it gives good recomendations based off of what you want to do. 

And lastly, the community forums! They are full of extremely helpful people who'll be happy to help you out with any problem you may have. I once had a problem with my mount, asked on the forum and within minutes I got a reply and fixed it! Stargazers Lounge and cloudy nights to name a few are great forums to look at. 

And remember, what ever happens in this hobby, just enjoy it! You're looking at objects located millions of lightyears away, basically looking into the past. It's such a unique and mysterious hobby that really puts you into perspective, always remember that and you'll do well!

I’m also planning to start astrophotography, but didn’t find the time to setup everything and experiment with the tutos I’ve found. Astrophoto requires both gear knowledge and skills in image processing, so that’s double the work. I’m super curious about learning all that, but my studies are quite time consuming, and the weather/light pollution in my area don’t help much hahah.

Didn’t even put my scope on station yet, with the equatorial mount, as I’ve just tried basic GoTo and using azimutal position for now (got an AZ-EQ5 pro GT mount). I’ve got most of the required gear, even though I do lack a reflex camera. I might have done the mistake to think I could do that kind of picture with an Altaïr GPCAM2 (colour), but from what I saw there, most of the awesome pics were done with a reflex camera, using the Altaïr-like cameras as guides instead of imaging.

May I ask you what guides/tutorials you used when you first started? I’d really like to do such promising shots myself.

We had coordinated similar events with them at other parks with very low interest/attendance but this last time we just lucked out and had lots of people stop by because they were already there for the new park. Also if we plan something formally in advance, half the time we have to cancel or get low attendance because of clouds or rain. That’s why I like the idea of showing up with a scope where people already are vs. planning at the risk of canceling or getting low attendance. A while back I saw a video of a guy that wheeled his scope around on city streets and let passers by look at the moon. A lot of them were seeing it up close for the first time. I really liked that approach because it literally brings astronomy to the public. But you’re right it does get tricky when you’re doing it as a private citizen versus a representative of a group so I’ll make sure we do it the right way.",,1578051262,{},fcx4tw1,True,t3_eizdsl,False,True,t1_fcwt2mh,/r/Astronomy/comments/eizdsl/ideas_for_growing_local_astronomy_group/fcx4tw1/,1578120462,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

I've been doing astrophotography for a year and a bit now. That's cool!

I too started with that same telescope, and here I am now! If you own a telescope and it makes you buy a new one, it's done a good job. It shows that you're committed to the hobby and enjoy every part of it. Going for a better scope is just part of your drive to get more out of it. 

I worked my way up pretty slowly. I went from that 130eq to a nexstar 5se, then to a heq5 pro with some other equipment. But to be honest, I wouldn't completely recomend my route. I spent a lot of money on things I didn't need, because I didn't know what I was doing. I ended up reselling a lot of my stuff and losing some money on it. I think one of the best ways to just get into astro is to buy a small, portable tracker mount like the ioptron skyguider. People take some amazing images on them and they really have some excellent possibilities. Just take a look at the YouTube channel Astrobackyard! One of these small trackers paired with a DSLR and lens is a great combination for starting out. They're not too expensive and will give you a proper taste for the night sky.

Remember, take your time with the hobby, the night sky isn't going anywhere soon! Relax and enjoy it for the amazing hobby it is!

Even if you have no equipment at the moment, it's good to get a feel for the night sky, get used to the temperature, the climate and the darkness. If you're just in your backyard, get used to that to! It's always good to do that before buying all this kit.

I took this out on numerous clear nights, looking at the moon and being fascinated by all I could see. Until the inevitable happened, I wanted bigger and better! So I bought myself a Celestron 130eq, which was a great little scope for visual observation of planets and the moon. Where astrophotography all begun was when I started using my phone to take pictures through it, and I realized the amazing possibilities you could get from your own back garden! It all spiraled on from there and I bought a second hand nexstar 5se. This was my first GoTo telescope, which could track the night sky and really allow me to get into astrophotography more. So I bought a canon 600d and started taking pictures through it. I was baffled and amazed by what came out! I was imaging deep sky objects millions of light years away, from my back garden, I loved it. And as you can imagine, I kept on going from there. Buying new equipment, learning new skills etc. 

Some tips if you would like to get started in this hobby: For one, make sure to buy the book 'Making every photon count' it's a brilliant book for beginners that you should read from cover to cover in order to get a good grasp on some of the technicalities behind the hobby. You'll understand the jargon we speak and it gives good recommendations on how to start out. I made the mistake of not buying this book when I first started, really because I didn't know what I was doing lol. A lot of the time you'll find that the number one recommendation for equipment when you start out is to buy the best mount you can! The mount is so important, it needs to have a good payload capacity and be strong. The HEQ5 pro I use is relatively inexpensive, especially second hand and is sturdy. Next, a small apochromatic refractor is a good option. They're easy to use and basically plug and play with a field flattener. Something like a explore scientific ed80 or smaller would be great. The reason I recommend a refractor over the others is due to their easy to use nature, decent prices and overall beginner friendliness. And for the camera, a dslr to start with is a great option. All of these images were taken with just a canon 600D that had been astro modified for better Ha sensitivity. Even a 1000D is a good option and at a cheaper price. 

And remember, this hobby will be difficult at times, even frustrating - but remember, what you're doing is amazing! You're taking pictures of objects where their light is millions of years old, we're basically looking into the past.

I've looked on youtube for things like ""how to start out with Astrophotography"" and lots of these guys that do it regard a Starter setup as using mounts that cost £900 and scopes that cost upwards of £1000.

I think it can be just as effective for a member or two to just show up at a public space with a scope and maybe some informational handouts, no planning necessary. 

I also like the idea of more hands-on workshops and events. Currently our monthly meetings consist of an hour long, pretty technical and information-heavy PowerPoint presented by a current member. It’s not the most exiting way for a potential new member to be introduced to our club and I can see a lot of people getting bored or intimidated by that and not returning.

The idea of loaning scopes is interesting too. I know the club has extra scopes and I think it’s understood among the more involved members that they can be borrowed, but I’m not sure that’s something we advertise. I’ll have to look into that more.

We host several stargazing events in the area throughout the month at different places around town as well as at our observatory for the public to attend. During new moon weekends we have our members only star party. Often this might include a potluck dinner before sunset and a short lecture or slide show given by a member or guest.  During the summer months the club hosts Star-B-Qs during the member star parties where we grill hot dogs and hamburgers with all the trimmings and members bring a side dish or dessert.  This usually brings everyone out of the woodwork and we get to see members we don't otherwise see.  Our club is also heavily involved in  research. We have worked with Kepler and now TESS identifying and confirming exoplanets, many of our members work with the International Occultation and Timing Assocciation measuring the size and shape of asteroids, and during one campaign to measure a particular asteroid, two of our club members discovered an unknown moon around the parent asteroid.  A lot of our members do variable star measurements for the AAVSO and we have a long standing collaboration with the University of Delaware and University of Texas observing white dwarf stars which has resulted in numerous members being listed as co-authors on peer reviewed research papers as a result of their contribution.  We also rent our observatory out to the general public for a modest fee if they wish to have their own private star party. We have had scout groups overnight at the observatory, had family reunions come out for the night, wedding anniversaries and birthday parties, and the odd corporate gathering.  The trick to all this is you have to be visible to the public. During our public events we hand out brochures with details about the club and contact info if folks want to join.  Once a month we put a little blurb in the local newspapers to announce our monthly public stargazing events, we have a FB and Twitter account that we post to frequently. Our website will auto email reminders of scheduled events on our club calendar to all registered members.  We also are involved with the regional ISD and local ISDs and surrounding schools. We get asked to do star parties for the students and participate in teacher workshops to help teachers hone their knowledge about astronomy.  Our club also collaborates with the local colleges where students can do research projects or thesis work with our observatory.  As a result of all the work we do, this alone is often incentive enough for people to join.  

But truth told, astronomy is not a working man's hobby. I've been with my club since I was 25 and it has always been mostly retired folks who can afford the time and money to invest in this hobby.   I actually tried to join my club when I was about 13 but got discouraged because it was ""just a bunch of old folks"".

During the 2012 transit of Venus, a teacher or parent (I forgot) at my school had a telescope set up with a solar filter, and we could observe the sun and Venus. I was into space at the time, but not astronomy itself, but it was so cool and I was instantly hooked.

Head to a school, the local park, city centre, or anywhere where there’s lots of people. Show random people who walk by visually stunning objects such as the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Pleiades and other DSO with your scopes. This is a good way to introduce people to astronomy, something which they probably wouldn’t have done themselves. From there, encourage them to join your club. Maybe offer a discount for anyone who comes to an outreach?

If you aren’t doing so, I’d recommend doing stuff like interactive workshops based on things nearly everyone in the club can do. So maybe something like learning to starhop, or finding the whole Messier list. Maybe even dabble into niches such as sketching or electronically assisted astronomy. The best way to learn things is to actually do them instead of just listening to someone showing you how to do it. 

Also loan out your more expensive scopes, but only allow people who attend regular meetings to borrow them. Perhaps a points system or something. This provides an incentive for people to head to meetings, as they want to try out the fancy gear, and also ensures that new guy wont be touching your super fancy 11” RASA very soon (if you have one, at least), so you’d feel a bit safer. And make sure to keep a good collection of beginner scopes - some people can’t afford to buy a scope, but being able to borrow one would be amazing for them. And eventually they could try out more fancy gear.

Maybe at the end of the meeting or viewing night, ask everyone to fill out a tiny survey where they just describe whether they enjoyed that night, and what can be improved.

This photo is something completely new for me because I got a new camera, the StarlightXpress SXVF-H16 mono. Before this camera I had a stock Canon 60D and all the capturing and processing is so different. The weather was also bad last month so I didn’t even have a chance to test this camera out for a month. But for the last 4 days we had a streak of clear nights, so I took the chance and started capturing lights on the Tadpoles Nebula

To take pictures of deep sky objects you take many long exposures and use software to stack them together.

When you're doing long exposures astrophotography you need an Equatorial mount that moves with the rotation of the Earth and always stays centered on the object you're photographing. Good eq mounts cost many more times than the telescope itself usually. We also use smaller telescopes as 'autoguiders' which make micro adjustments to the eq mount to make sure everything is smooth.

No you don't need a dedicated astronomy camera. You can use an adapter and an everyday DSLR.

Astrophotography is expensive. Unless you have a few thousand dollars spare better to stick to plain old visual astronomy.

For finding objects visually we use a technique called starhopping. In a nutshell this is bouncing from a really obvious easy object or star to a nearby one, and another, and another until you finally find the object you're looking for. 

A good book like *Turn Left At Orion*, and a good app like *Stellarium* make starhopping easier.

It also helps to have either a Telrad or a magnified finderscope or both. These help you to point your telescope in the general ballpark of whatever you're searching for.

To use the eyepieces in a scope to find objects. First use your widest angle lowest magnification eyepiece (it will have a higher number like 32mm or 25mm). Then when you've found your object pop in increasingly higher magnification eyepieces (increasingly smaller numbers eg. 15mm --&gt; 10mm --&gt; 6mm etc.) Until you find a view you like.

I recently became interested in the surface of Titan. I am writing a short sci-fi story revolving around Titan, and I wanted to make sure I didn't make any huge mistakes when mentioning places and surface features of this fascinating moon.

So, I looked for the most detailed map of the surface:

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22770

However, it was lacking surface features and a grid to be able to know the coordinates of a point on the surface. I found another map:

https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20713

But the grid wasn't accurate enough for my needs, and it was using older images of Titan's surface. I also found this 3D model (glTF) by NASA, using the aforementioned older images of Titan's surface:

https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2347/titan-surface-3d-model/

Hence, I decided to create a map that would fit my needs. With the aid of Photoshop, I started counting pixels to create the grid. Separation between meridians or parallels is 7.5º. I also labelled all surface features mentioned in:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Titan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_of_Titan

Some coordinates were wrong in the Wikipedia, and I have corrected as many as I have detected, but there might still be some errors in the map due to this.

**Here is the folder with all the maps and 3D models I have created or modified for download:**

https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ve39jhk1t95v0/Titan

Just as NASA did with their maps, I am releasing these to the Public Domain, in case there is interest of any type.

The *.glb models can be viewed by downloading them and uploading them to a site such as this one:

https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/

Any comments appreciated.

The shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy.

Cosmologists distinguish between the observable universe and the global universe.

With eyepieces you generally want to upgrade atleast a little bit from what comes with the scope.   The cheap ones that everyone recommends are gold lines or  red lines.    Typically when you upgrade eyepieces, the image quality does improve, but not that much.   Most of the image quality improvement is seen near the outside of the field of view in your eyepiece where chromatic aberration is most apparent.   This is when the object you are looking at gets a little fuzzier and discoloration can be seen.

A large idea of open source software is that *I don't have to rely on you creating executables*, because I'll have the capacity to do it myself after making sure that I trust the source code.

Of course, what you want to do with your software is completely up to you, but if you were so inclined, here are some obvious advantages:

* Ideas and discussion from the community: Someone reviewing the code can suggest ways to improve performance or solve problems that you've been breaking your head on. Something incredibly useful for the kind of project you're working on.
* Attribution: Making a project open source believe it not actually prevents theft because there is a recorded log of credited authors. These even hold up in court. Copyleft has long been a thing and even absolves you of responsibilities resulting from someone else's misuse.
* Feedback: People on Reddit telling you how the video of your software looks is great, but it doesn't compare to someone else telling you how the software works and what in particular worked/didn't work for them.

There are many, many solo personal projects on Github, and I'd wager they'd all agree that it's not at all like having someone else come in and write music for you.

If I may, it's more analogous to writing the entire piece yourself, but open source is the stage and the few people who showed up for your practice rehearsal the day before your actual performance.",,1577751976,{},fclnjfx,False,t3_ehrqj9,False,True,t1_fcll31j,/r/Astronomy/comments/ehrqj9/this_is_a_software_project_im_working_on_im/fclnjfx/,1577751979,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

I decided to make a composite of some of my favorite photographs from this last year. Although I've shot around 90 different images, most of them are some of the more ""boring"" star clusters. I'm hoping to finish up photographing the entire [Messier Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object) by next summer, as [I only have ~15 objects left to shoot](https://i.imgur.com/XnTBVNU.png). The 8 images in this composite represent **103.5 hours of total exposure time**, most of which has been from the roof of my light polluted apartment. According to my spreadsheet I have close to 370 hours of total exposure time across all of my images for 2019. Getting my setup almost entirely automated early this year really helped me take advantage of every clear night I got. I have links below if you want to check out the uncropped original photos, as well as their specific acquisition and processing details[.](https://i.imgur.com/zBrZtOZ.jpg)

A few commonly asked questions about my photos:

**How do you take long exposures of the sky moves?**

* I use an equatorial mount to [track the movement of the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYkY_JYfKlY) and take long exposures without the stars trailing. I also take several hundred shorter exposures (~5 minutes each) and stack them together to create one single image that then goes onto post processing.

**Are the Colors Real?**

* Most of these images are in false color, however images 2, 6, and 7 are considered to be true color (although our puny eyeballs alone will never be able to see color in these objects, even through a telescope). The false color images are somewhat close to true color however, with hydrogen gas being mapped more to red, and oxygen being mapped more to blue. I use a black and white camera, and have to take images through filters which are then mapped to RGB channels in order to produce a color image.

**What is your light pollution/How do you deal with it?**

* Most of these were photographed from the roof of my apartment, which is under Bortle 7 light pollution (9 being the highest). Images 2, 6, and part of 7 were shot from the Deerlick Astronomy Village, which is under Bortle 3 light pollution. In order to deal with the light pollution I use narrowband filters which only let through specific wavelengths of light (the specific wavelength that these nebulae emit) and block out almost all other light. It is possible to get good photos without using any kind of light pollution filters, and I've found a lot of the messier clusters are great targets for heavy LP and/or full moon nights.

**Pert II:**

Marvin del Cid, a journalist with Diario Libre, considers himself to be ""just a small link in this whole chain of people and events"", and understands that the December solstice event was ""like a mandate"" to name the stars assigned to the Dominican Republic. For him it is ineffable what he feels, after the names he suggested, through the project 'Name Exoworlds', were chosen to designate universally and forever a star (Márohu) and its exoplanet (Boinayel).

**A new approach**

Archaeologist Domingo Abreu understands that the findings in these caves ""pose a new approach to Antillean archaeology, based on the cave manifestations"".

""So far, archaeological studies have been based on material remains found: complete vessels, idols, fragments, pieces of bone, clay, shell and, mainly, on the Arawak trail. However, we have found in this and other caves the Mayan, Inca and Nahua trail, which makes it necessary for us to take a new approach to archaeological study in the Caribbean area,"" Abreu said.

**The Astronomical Leap of Taino Civilization**

- In the Cueva del Puente, every December solstice, there is an event that invites to revalue the Taino culture

- Today the country has two bodies in the universe named after the original inhabitants of the Caribbean

Henry Hidalgo - 30/12/2019

Until a few weeks ago, Márohu (god of clear weather) and Boinayel (god of rain) rested in the stillness of the Cuevas de Borbón or Pomier Anthropological Reserve, in the province of San Cristóbal, sculpted specifically in a stalagmite from the Cueva del Puente.


Fray Ramón Pané wrote about these two deities of the Taino culture at the end of the 15th century in his ""Report on the Antiquities of the Indians"", a compendium that has been considered the first work written in the New World in a European language.

In his account, Pané emphasizes that, for the natives, the Sun and the Moon came out of this cave, -called Iguanaboina by them-, and that Márohu and Boinayel were two cemíes who enjoyed ""much esteem"" because when the rains did not present credentials, as the Tainos told Pané, they would turn a visit to the cave and it would immediately rain.


Friar Ramon Pané himself described the cemíes in careful detail: ""[...] made of stone, small, the size of half an arm, with their hands tied, and they seemed to be sweating"".

**A unique find**

For a little over forty years, Dominican archaeologist and speleologist Domingo Abreu has been inspecting the Cueva del Puente, and in one of his visits, he noticed that Márohu and Boinayel were practically untouched by the sun's rays that gradually penetrated from the top to the depths of the cave.


Travel underground to see the Taino New Year at El Pomier
Everything changed forever when Abreu decided to go to the cave at a time of the year when the sun's rays reach their greatest inclination towards the south, specifically at the December solstice. 
The find was surprising: Márohu and Boinayel, the cemíes who remain in the shadows for months, were touched at their base by sunlight after one o'clock in the afternoon on December 21st, in what is now considered a unique astronomical-anthropological event.

**From the stillness to the stars**

This link of two cemíes with the solstice, the sunlight and the undeniable connection of the Tainos with their natural environment, served as a support for the journalist Marvin del Cid, who together with Domingo Abreu had visited the Cueva del Puente on the solstices of December 2017 and 2018, proposed, at the beginning of last November, to Márohu and Boinayel as names for the star WASP-6 and its exoplanet WASP-6 b, through 'Name ExoWorlds', an initiative of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

And so it was that the god of clear weather and his twin, the god of rain, ""abandoned"" the Cueva del Puente on the morning of December 17, 2019, when the IAU announced through its social networks that both had been selected, from the 618 proposals received, to officially name two bodies of the universe in representation of the Dominican Republic.

**In the Cueva del Puente**

Four days after the selection of the Taino deities by the **International Astronomical Union**, Diario Libre went once again to the Cueva del Puente, together with several people who were involved in one way or another with the initiative of naming a star and its exoplanet in the country, to document with them the event that took Márohu and Boinayel up to the sky.

""The fundamental value of this cave is to have the greatest amount of pictographic manifestations of Inca ancestry, which is totally different from what appears in other caves. Here we have Inca symbolism, like the condor, and there is, naturally, the representation in one piece, in one stalagmite, of Boinayel and Márohu"", said Domingo Abreu, who witnessed for the first time the effect of sunlight in the cave and documented it together with Marvin del Cid for the third year in a row.

For Dominican astrophysicist Mayte Vasquez, the key person before the IAU to have an exoplanet and its star assigned to the Dominican Republic, it was ""very impressive"" and a ""unique experience"" to contemplate the December solstice event in the Cueva del Puente. ""To see at one o'clock in the afternoon how a ray of sunshine is approaching, (which) illuminates the feet of the cemíes, because it is a unique connection to our ancestors,"" said Vásquez.

In the words of the president of the Dominican Astronomical Society, Manuel Grullón, ""it is incredible to see and understand that the Tainos had or could handle, through their observation, this kind of event and that they honored in this cave those two cemíes that they venerated"".

4977,[],,harpage,,,[],,,,text,t2_4psg5pc4,False,False,[],"You absolutely have to use a ""tracking tripod"" (known as an Equatorial Mount) to take exposures longer than a few seconds at focal lengths like these. You could get away with 20-30 second exposures untracked, but you need a wide angle lens, and even then, it's really only good for the Milky Way and the largest constellations.

Astrophotography is a very expensive hobby, and a decent setup will cost way more than what your telescope is probably worth. Contrary to popular belief, the most important thing in astrophotography is not the telescope or lens itself, but rather the mount you use. You want to get a good mount to accurately and stably hold your camera and telescope/lens whilst it tracks the stars. Beginner mounts capable of holding a telescope or telephoto lens start at about $1000 USD with the Orion Sirius or HEQ5, but if your just using a DSLR and short lens you can get what OP got, the Skywatcher Star Adventurer for about $400-500.

Then you need to factor in a camera itself if you don't have one, and the actual telescope/lens you will be using. For beginners, you'd ideally want a nice apochromatic refractor or quality telephoto lens (though I wouldn't recommend buying one unless you already have one, because they're expensive) and the appropriate field flattener. Some people use reflectors, but refractors are easier to use and offer a much wider FOV. Apochromatic refractors start at about $450 (William Optics ZS61, Apertura 60EDR, Astrotech 60AT, etc), but can easily be 5x or even 10x that. Then you need to get a field flattener for said telescope, which will run you about $200. So in total, thats about $1850 USD for a kit **without** a camera, guiding system (which you'll eventually want), filters, and other necessary accessories.

As you can see, it's a very expensive hobby. But you can use a DSLR and tripod alone, but don't expect to get images like what OP got.",,1577693169,{},fcjlypp,False,t3_ehhauw,False,True,t1_fcje4lw,/r/Astronomy/comments/ehhauw/m42_the_orion_nebula_and_running_man_nebula/fcjlypp/,1577696046,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

This night was Pretty clear in my small town in Bavaria. I learned a lot of my previous mistakes and had a pretty good Polar alignment tonight.
Also i put some bricks under my tripod because it sank slightly into the ground, i used an app (PS Align) to calculate “polar scope Reticle Centering Error”

The outside temperature was around -5 C

My Set up: 

Mount: SkyWatcher Star Adventurer 
Camera: Canon 60D (unmodified)
Scope: Sigma APO 170 - 500 (@400mm )
Lens heater and dew shield 
Not auto guided 

Camera settings:

Iso: 1600

Aperture: f/6.3

Exposure: 60s 

Focal length 400mm 

Lights: 80 x 60s 

Darks: 25

Bias: 25

Flats: 30 


for the core i made 20 extra frames with 10 seconds exposure. (but no calibration files)

Post Processing:

Stacked in DeepSkyStacker 

Processed in Photoshop:


Cropped slightly, 
Standard curve stretch,
Brightness and contrast ,
Dynamic and Saturation,
Made the stars slightly smaller,
Blended in the second picture to bing down the brightness of the core (layermask),
Noise reduction (Camera Raw Filter) ,
and some more adjustments until i liked it.

Scaled distance is not ‘realistically’ possible for the planet sizes you’re using.  The distances, even with small scaled planets, are insanely large.  For example if you use the Jupiter size you’re currently using, the sun would be on one side of a city and Pluto would be on the other.  I can imagine taking a trip through manhattan with friends, stopping at each planet, awesome field trip!  Much better to use two separate scales, though; one for size (so the planets are big enough to see), and one for distance (so you can fit them in a realistic space).  Doing both at one scale just doesn’t work well in spaces like football fields or smaller.  I’d be happy to help you with the scaling math, I do planets size and distance scaling with my middle school students every year.

Then you have a cheap telescope taking up space in your closet. There are a few different types that range in price and operation pretty significantly. 

How do you use someone else's? Get involved in a local astronomers club and you'll see a variety that you can look at and knowledgeable people who can get you started. Also, start learning the sky without aids like telescopes otherwise you'll be flailing around in the dark. Star charts like [skymaps](http://www.skymaps.com/) work great for this. Just make sure you have the right one for your longitude and using it at the time it states.

Without getting into the jargon, I started with a motorized Celestron. But even with the tech, I personally found the telescope a pain to use. Mainly due to user error; I would align to the wrong star, which throws off the whole thing. A friend built me a 8"" dobsonain. Not motorized at all so I had to find things on my own. First thing I saw was Orion's Nebula and it was so freaking rewarding because I found it myself. The real money pit is the eyepieces and quality eyepieces is what gets you views like above*.

So yeah, don't jump in with a cheap telescope or dump tons of money into one you won't be able to work properly. This is a hobby/profession that takes a whole lot of patience, but the places it will take you and the things you learn along the way are simply interstellar.

*Eyepieces are important to see clearly but the amount of light captured by the telescope plays a large roll as well. Again not trying to get too bogged down in the details.

Ive pushed my Celestron 5i at F10 up to 90sec without star trails. Those mounts are not exactly known for their highly accurate tracking for AP use. I was able to get 180sec out of it but there were too many bad frames to waste the time with that exposure length. 

I added a heavy duty wedge to it and spent about an hour getting an alignment on Polaris (mostly it was fussing with the mount to get it aligned before fine tuning it).

I would actually recommend starting with something mid-range like an Orion Atlas or Celestron CGX if you can afford it.

As long as your mount is good, the rest of the rig can be relatively entry-level price stuff. You can get decent budget apochromatic refractors for just a few hundred bucks and small guidescopes for even under a hundred. Imo any decent DSLR camera will do.

This is an example of what happens when a sun-sized star runs out of nuclear fuel.

I shot images for about 27 hours total to complete this image.    My telescope rides on a tracking mount to counteract the Earth’s spin.

If you’d like to read on, here’s a little description of what you are seeing...

As a sun-like star begins to deplete it’s hydrogen fuel, a sequence of interesting change is initiated. The core, unable to support its own crushing gravity, compresses and increases dramatically in temperature. In an opposite fashion, outer atmosphere swells and cools under the intense pressure from within. A red giant is born.

Though there are several possible outcomes, many stars begin to gradually shed the outer atmosphere to deep space. This is the beginning of a planetary nebula.

As the core continues its collapse it emits extreme ultraviolet radiation. The radiation ionizes the gasses of the nebula giving rise to a wonderfully colorful and intricate design.

In this case, the stellar parent is a binary star system. This pair, one dying, sculpts a unique and beautifully complex nebula. Romantic or cannibalistic?

Enjoy!   Let me know what you think.  If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer them.

I’ll tell you right now that it can get expensive very quickly, so please do research before you purchase equipment and what not. 

You will need a German equatorial mount. Period. You’ll get field rotation with an alt-az mount so they aren’t great for photography. There are a lot of good options when it comes to GEMs. Just make sure that it is enough to handle the load of the telescope, camera, guide scope, etc. 

Pretty much all experienced astrophotographers would recommend a small refractor as your starter. This is because the small focal length has a large FOV and it makes things such as small guiding errors more forgiving than say a SCT. These are much better for nebulae and galaxies, where as the SCT shines with planetary imaging. The catch here is that you want the quality of the glass to be very good, so expect to pay for it. Again, a lot of great options there, I’ll let others recommend brands. 

As far as the camera goes, a lot of people are switching to the CCDs and rightfully so. Stock DSLR cameras get the job done but without filters they aren’t the best for AP, but you can get them modded specifically for it. The more expensive CCDs have cooling features which really helps with noise reduction. 

There are narrowband and broadband filters you can attach to the camera to take different sets of data that you can combine later in processing software. You can combine these to get great detail. Shooting with the HA filter in the city is a miracle. 

If you want exposures longer than say 2 minutes you’ll need a guide scope. You’ll need to get a separate camera to act as your auto guider.

5313,[],,chris_33,,,[],,,,text,t2_ytpya,False,False,[],"since you can't use the internet for information i won't use it as well:

the angular resolution of your telescope is given by:

α = 1.22 \* λ/D

λ ... wavelength you observe with, visible light goes from around 400 nm to around 700 nm, i am going to use 500 nm for the estimation 

D ... diameter of your telescopes, i am not sure which one you have exactly, i am using 76 mm for this estimation

α = 8.026e-6 rad = 1.66"" 

rad to "" is \*180/π\*3600

so that's the smallest angle you can see with your telescope 

now to the angular size of the ISS:

pretty hard without internet to estimate tbh. Two things we need, how high up is it. I know it's around 400 km, since i havecalculated something related to the ISS in every astrophysics course, so i am using this

i don't know how wide it is, i am guessing it's around 100 metres 

for the angular size we have:

tan β/2 = w/2 /d 

w ... width of the object, so 100 metres 

d ... distance to the observer, i am using 400 km

-&gt; β = 0.0143° = 51.7""

so your resolution is 1.66"" while the ISS should be around 50"", should be easily doable 

i don't know if i used too much info, can't do it with less

if you do this what also would be interesting, how the results compare to a different method i was thinking of

for that one you have to know how long the ISS is and also the size of an reference object something like the moon

to sketch my thoughts:

you know (if you google it) the diameter of the moon, you also know the distance, therefore you know the angular size a""

then you count x pixels of the moons diameter, you know then a"" equals x pixels

then you count y pixels of the ISS (i don't know what school and grade you are, but you could get crazy with sub-pixel accuracy if you want to) 

you know a"" equals x pixels, with the y pixels that gives you the angular size of the b"" of the ISS

when you know the (googled) with of the ISS you can calculate the distance to you

then you need to know the angle at which the picture was shot and that gives you distance above the ground - looking at the top comment

The barn door tracker offsets the earths rotation so that you can track objects for long exposures with no streaking. You can build a manual one from scraps and commonly found parts. For far less than $100 USD, you can motorized it.

To actually take photos, you typically take a lot of shots for as long as you can without streaking. Then on a computer stack them together, and the tweak them to pull out details and add color.

Ulugh Beg's primary instrument, the Fakhrī sextant, is essentially a gigantic piece of a protractor. Based on its configuration, my assumption is that this was really only good for solar (and perhaps lunar) observations as they cast as shadow. In [this image](https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzFlMjY2NTY0YTc5ZTM0M2UzOWM4ZWFlY2VlZTBjOWRjNjViZWNkN2QuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMjAweD4iXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il1d/1e266564a79e343e39c8eaeceee0c9dc65becd7d.jpg), you can get an idea of how it would have worked: The window at the far end faces south and the sun will stream in through that window. If a bar were placed across that window, it would cast a shadow on the scale and when the sun is lined up perfectly south along the meridian, the width of the window would fall perfectly on the width of the scale indicating precisely when it was solar noon.

Since the sun changes altitude throughout the year, this would change. The length of time between the extremes of those changes is the length of the year. However, that's not an integer value, so the average of many years would have to be taken to get down to the ultimate precision cited. The angle between the mean and the extremes is the obliquity of the ecliptic. 

The same is true of Gaocheng; it is a solar observatory. However instead of a curved arc, it appears to use a straight one which will obviously lead to distortions in the spacing between units so it must have taken this into account. Both of these instruments get their power by simply being extremely more massive allowing for greater precisions.

Stjerneborg is a different story as it housed a large number of instruments. Only a few of them were sunk into the ground, such as the one seen on [page 28 in this translation of his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica](http://jonvoisey.net/Astronomiae_Instauratae_Mechanica.pdf). This instrument is absolutely for stars and planets and is used by sighting along the alidade AK. However, you'll notice that if you look along it you're always pointing up, out of the hole or structure in which it resides, so you will always have an unobstructed view. Only when you get very close to the horizon does it become a problem but given the amount of atmospheric distortion which Tycho was well aware of, observing near the horizon is not productive anyway. However, this instrument is able to rotate both in altitude and azimuth. The radius of the quadrant is about 5.5 ft, and with precision engraving on the scale, Tycho's instruments were able to be accurate to a few seconds of arc.",,1577542468,{},fc8v26l,False,t3_egqdie,False,True,t3_egqdie,/r/Astronomy/comments/egqdie/how_did_pretelescope_observatories_like_ulugh_beg/fc8v26l/,1577542478,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

Tonight I will do another round of observation to confirm or do dismiss. And I hope that other people have yesterday, and/or will do tonight.

I will observe tonight again to confirm or to draw different conclusions. Thus why I asked for confirmations from different spots around the globe it wasn’t a local phenomena and it has something to do with dust, or interplanetary objects.

On top of that I decided to make it an HaLRGB image, I estimated roughly 11 hours per panel, 5 to Ha, 3 to L and 3 to RGB. In actuality it equated to 32.5 hours total!
This has been my most ambitious project yet, I spent over a month just acquiring the sufficient data, several days spent processing (9k x 4k images are slow on my computer)
So I hope you enjoy it!

* Acquired with the NINA imaging suite. Guided with PHD2. Mount interface: EQMOD

**Processing:** 

Created 12 stacks, HaLRGB per panel. (3 panels)
The RGB for each panel was ABE'd, then linear fitted then RGB combined, resulting in 3 RGB images representing each panel.
Each L panel had DBE applied, TGV and MMT for NR. 
Each Ha panel had the same as L but additionally Deconvolution.

3 Mosaics were then created from all these panels as such:
Platesolved central panel, created a Catalog Star image the size of the mosaic (10kx4k)
Star aligned each panel to this catalog star image.
DNALinearfitted the 3 panels.
GMM to combine.

As a result an Ha, L and RGB mosaic were generated.

Then L and R (in the RGB) were enhanced with the Ha via the pixel math detailed in the LVA tutorial.
The RGB was then stretched slightly with arcinsh and then HT.
The L was stretched with just HT.

Then had to perform a fix on the stars in the central panel red channel of the RGB mosaic. This stack used out of focus red data, and I for some reason let it progress this far down the line without noticing (I guess this is what you get for processing at 3am). 
This fixed involved making a starmask using starnet and then clonestamping out in focus stars. Applying mask to the red channel and using deconvolution motion blur.


Star reduction on both the RGB and L.
LRGB Combination with chrominance NR.
Several rounds of curves and LHE with masks targetting different brightness regions of the image.
Masked out the flame nebula to shift the red hues away that come from the Ha. This achieves the normal RGB look which is more appealing for the flame.
HDRMT on small reflection nebula (really minor)
Brought image into PS for Selective colour, toyed with the sliders to push the pinky reds into a deeper red colour.
Back into PI, using starnet, desaturated the reds in the stars (rather intense red stars from arcinsh).

Bit of clone stamping out some artefacts from GMM and blue spike from alnitak that extended the whole image.

**Other notes:**

Definitely a few hiccups can be noticed at 1:1 scale, primarily red channel on the central panel was out of focus and so the stars were quite bad, still residual issues.
The noise profile differs between the panels and so an edge can be spotted.
HFR/FWHM on the right panel is much greater due to lower guiding quality. (possibly nights with bad seeing)

Even on the Skywatcher website do they not mention or show telescopes - only lenses. So I don’t see the point in lying to try and prove your point.

If your camera weighs less than literally a glass of water, then I’d assume it’s not too good for AP. People generally use DSLRs or cooled CCDs, all of which definitely do not weigh 1/4 pound. Most of them weigh at least 1lb or more.

People struggle with the Star Adventurer @300mm unguided. Now imagine 2x that - all the errors will be more apparent and every breeze will be more visible. You WILL need a guiding setup for anything over 400mm, and 650mm is quite over that. Add a guide scope and guide camera, and you’ll already be way over the limit even without a camera. And it’ll be difficult to actually balance your scope with 1kg of counterweights, and with such a tiny dovetail. Plus there’s no dovetail saddle on the declination axis, so you’ll be forced to thread 650mm of scopes onto that tiny L-bracket, so you’re bound for a ton of flexture. Speaking about declination, the Star Adventurer doesn’t guide in that axis so good luck if you have any errors in polar alignment or wind, which will most definitely be apparent at 650mm.

Plus unless you have a special photographic reflector, you’ll face issues with back focus. It probably only has a 1.25” focuser as well, so you’ll need to upgrade the focuser to remove vignetting and to fit the most important accessory - a coma corrector. It’s possible to do AP without it, but only the centre of the picture will look nice. Point is, you’ll be much happier with using your camera and a lens than a reflector and camera with your Star Adventurer.",,1577501659,{},fc7a8k1,False,t3_eg0qzh,False,True,t1_fc5m1op,/r/Astronomy/comments/eg0qzh/looking_for_the_right_tripod_for_astrophotography/fc7a8k1/,1577501660,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

Your comparison is very unfair to the tin foil. We need an energy release of more like 10^-16 Joules. A sound wave with this amount of energy is below the limit of human hearing.

Without a tracking mount, you’re really limited to wide field (low magnification) shots with very short exposures.   As long as you can mount your camera to the eyepiece with a stable mount and activate your camera without touching it, you should be able to get some cool shots.  It’s all about stability.  With some phones you can activate the shutter with the volume button on the earbud cables, which is ideal because you don’t disturb your mount that way.  You can also use a 10s timer, which will allow the telescope to re-stabilize after you’ve touched the shutter button on your phone camera.  Keep experimenting and reading and your skill will improve quickly.   Don’t get discouraged - this hobby can be frustrating at any skill level, but it’s so rewarding when you capture a great shot, and sitting outside on a dark night, watching the sky, is one of life’s simplest pleasures!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sharing with you the progress I've made in this new hobby for me. I bought my first telescope on February this year and when I first saw Jupiter and its moons on the eyepiece I couldn't resist snapping a picture with my phone. It came out like a fuzzy white smudge and I was still excited to be able to take a picture of a planet so far away from us right from my rooftop. I instantly got hook with planetary imaging and started to look up how to take better pictures of them with the equipment I had.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the pictures were taking using my Celestron Nexstar 6SE with a 2x Barlow. At first, my main gear for photography was my iphone 6 and sometimes I would borrow a Canon 70D DSLR from a  friend. So I had limited time with it and couldn't really get the hang of it for planetary, you can see this as my iphone pictures were turning out with a similar quality and by July I could say I was getting better results with my phone than a $2.000 camera. But then I got my dedicated camera for planetary imaging and I was amazed of the jump in quality. I can't wait to use it on opposition and to take my first images of Mars and Venus.

&amp;#x200B;

The butterfly nebula
Looking deep into the Orion arm of our home Galaxy there's a beautiful nebula about 3000 light years from us. This here is the butterfly nebula, a diffuse emmission nebula and a part of a much larger nebula filled with star clusters, gas and dust. Some people call the whole nebula the gamma cygni nebula and some call it the sadr region for the bright foreground star that sits about halfway between us and the nebula itself

1.  48 MP is way more resolution than you need because your optics actually limit the effective resolution.  If you can shoot at a lower resolution, post processing and storage will be much easier.  

2.  I noticed your stars are streaked (not pinpoint).  This indicates movement during exposure.  1s is a very short exposure, so I wouldn’t expect to see this.  I’m guessing you’re shooting through an eyepiece; you may want to consider a longer focal length eyepiece to reduce the magnification and widen the field of view.  This will both brighten your image and reduce streaking if the stars.  A properly aligned motor-driven tracking mount is your best bet, though.  Of course, that costs money!

Hmm some dubious answers in the comments. Newtonian gravity says its a force, and Einstein's general relativity says it is a curving of spacetime, and changes that lead to gravitional waves propogate at the speed of light. If the sun vanished, it would take 8 minutes before earth would start heading off in a ""straight line"".

We know its CAUSED by mass. We dont exactly know WHY it curves spacetime.

Curved spacetime is quite easy to visualize why a body orbits another body. It thinks its going in a straight line, the straight line is curved!

However, it is not fully know what causes a body to START moving towards another body. So, throwing a tennis ball away from me, sure it follows a curved path until it hits the ground. If I drop it from my hand, why is it compelled to move into a more elongated area of spacetime?

We simply dont know a lot of that stuff yet. BUT from what I understand from General Relativity,  time is passing more slowly nearer a massive object, and for some reason, an otherwise-stationary (in its own frame of reference) object (like a tennis ball I let go of) wants to get down into that slower time.

There are many resources for image processing techniques, as well as a few helpful forums (Cloudynights.com, for example).  You’ll find numerous resources and folks are generally very happy to help.  

Your image is a great example to learn from.  Unfortunately, your ability to effectively edit it is highly dependent on your budget.   Can you tell us a little about the equipment you used?

The first thing you notice is the “vignette” effect, where the image is much brighter in the center.  This is due to effects from the optical tube and can be tricky to fix.  Some software packages can deal with it to some extent, but the most effective method is to take “flat frames” and use a program called “Deep Sky Stacker” to normalize the brightness across the image.  You’ll need to do some reading to figure this out because it’s really beyond the scope of a comment on Reddit.  Some programs that allow you to add the vignette effect also allow you to “subtract” it, such as Lightroom (free app on iPhone), but the effectiveness is limited.  

As far as brightness and contrast go, there are many free options to explore and they can help you get the most out of your image.   For my money, I would purchase a program called Startools.  It’s inexpensive and can deal with vignetting, noise, and color correction.

If you want a computer to find objects for you, then you'll be looking at a 'Goto mount'. These cost a lot more than a typical Dobsonian scope!

My 'Goto Mount' is my brain + a copy of Stellarium  ;)

When buying a large telescope, really take the weight into account. If you can't face dragging the scope into the garden because it's cumbersome heavy, then it'll be a waste of money. You're not going to get anything that heavy for under $300 though. A 6"" is probably the best deal. Something like this: https://optcorp.com/products/orion-skyquest-xt6-classic-dobsonian-telescope-kit

Also bear in mind that you could easily many times that initial $300 on accessories. I have well over £1000 in accessories, while my scope cost me £200. Luckily I feel I have everything I need, although a new focuser wouldn't go amiss...

A cosmological horizon is a measure of the distance from which one could possibly retrieve information. This observable constraint is due to various properties of general relativity, the expanding universe, and the physics of Big Bang cosmology. Cosmological horizons set the size and scale of the observable universe. This article explains a number of these horizons.

It is known to periodically dim, and its believed there is a longer cycle that is like hundreds of years, and a shorter cycle of hundreds of days, that each contribute to its variations in observed brightness. The theory is that the two cycles are currently overlapping, leading to its excessive and rapid dimming. Having said that, this is the dimmest it’s ever been recorded to be, with the second dimmest having been in the 1920s. 

All that being said, I’m no mathematician but I’d say the chances are quite slim.

I started with the DGM NPB filter and it does an amazing job on many popular nebula like the Lagoon and Swan.  For my second filter I added a good Oiii filter which works well on many planetary nebula and supernova remnants.

The very base interaction of a sun is turning hydrogen to helium. This fusion of atoms creates energy aka light and heat. Then more fusion happens with bigger and bigger atoms to create oxygen, magnesium, potassium etc.

Because bigger atoms are heavier, the bigger fusions happen towards the center of the sun. That energy pushes out all the lighter elements making the sun not collapse.

Eventually though the atoms become iron (now I can't remember why it's iron specifically so maybe someone else can fill in). Once things hit iron, they can't fuse anymore because the required energy to fuse is too high. Therefore there's no more fusion energy pushing all the lighter elements out from the center, so everything rushes into the center.

A solar mass is just a unit that represents the mass of our sun for comparison. A star with less than 8 solar masses becomes a dwarf star (usually red), higher than 8 makes a supernova, and around 25 generally makes black holes.

For my Google Pixel I use [Camera-FV5](https://www.camerafv5.com/)

I have recently tried the [astrophotography mode](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2019/11/smartphone-astrophotography-google-pixel-3/) on my Google Pixel 3 and it was amazing.  I was able to capture the Pleiades without a tripod.  Since you have a Pixel 4, put it on a tripod and take photos.  You'll be amazed.

[Smartphone astrophotography](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2018/07/smartphone-astrophotography-6-steps/) tips can be found all over Google.

Post processing:

For Deep Sky Objects I use [Deep Sky Stacker](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html) to stack the photos into one.  Then I use [StarTools](https://www.startools.org/) and finish with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

For Solar System Objects I use the following and in this order, [PIPP](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/), [AutoStakkert](https://www.autostakkert.com/), [Registax](https://www.astronomie.be/registax/), GIMP.

I started Astrophotography with a Newtonian telescope (Orion Astroview 6).  It works great for visual and my smartphone astrophotography.  I later modified it to [move prime focus](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2019/03/orion-astroview-6-equipment-spotlight-moving-prime-focus/) and now use it with a Canon EOS T3i camera.

As far as a guide to [buying a telescope](https://kevinrfrancis.com/2018/08/telescope-buying-guide/), this too is all over Google.  Probably the most popular topic to write an article in this space.  I recommend starting with a newtonian telescope and Star Parties are the best way to try before you buy.

Here is what I hope is a Holiday surprise... a nebula you have likely never seen before!

[\[Original Source\]](https://www.adamblockphotos.com/cw-tauri.html)

The Taurus Molecular Cloud time and again offers celestial beauty in its many folds. Shown here perhaps for the first time at this resolution and in color are the environs of CW Tauri. This star, just to the right of the other two that illuminate this dark pocket of dust, is like its neighbors very young and varies in its brightness dramatically. During the course of taking this picture it changed in its brightness by 2 magnitudes! The reddish jet to the right is likely an unknown Herbig-Haro object. So many subtle gifts in a single field.

It is perhaps fitting to release this image now since these stars epitomize new beginnings having just recently been born (on stellar times scales). We now approach a new year and a new decade with its own nascent hopes and aspirations. Special thanks to a friend who honored my (seemingly crazy) request and acquired the data for this wonderful object using his telescope.

With that I offer my best wishes to you during the Holidays and the start of the New Year!

P.S. I also included a small video at the original source showing the variability of CW Tauri.

Venus is bright enough to be captured by a standard phone camera, but for better results, you should do long exposures. Do you have an iPhone? You can get NightCap for a couple of dollars, and will allow you to take long exposure photos which can capture stars and planets. Otherwise, you can point your phone at Venus and slide the exposure setting up until you see it (basically any phone from the past 5 years or so will have a camera powerful enough to do this). But Venus will appear as a bright white spot (just like how you see it from Earth).

If you want a close up view, then I think you’d be disappointed. From Earth, Venus only appears as a plain yellowish-white disc (with phases, so either a crescent or oval) with no visible surface details. And because of how low it is compared to the horizon, Venus will have lots of colour fringing as the atmosphere is so thick and distorts the light. The top and bottom will appear red/blue. The true beauty of Venus only shows up with physically close up shots, or shots in wavelengths other than visible light.

In Japan these stars are called Subaru (of car brand and Mains Kea telescope fame). They have been known by many names and many cultures throughout history. There is evidence of the their importance to the Celts, Aztecs, Persians, Cherokee, the many Polynesian peoples - and so many more.

For me they were an early telescope target when I was 12, and I've loved them ever since!

I was able to grab a quick 45 minutes or so of Orion as he shot through a small gap in the trees and powerlines where I’m living this winter. Gave me a fun chance to try out my big Atlas rig with a little 200mm lens on my camera. Less fun was trying to troubleshoot some camera issues and achieve focus by bare hand in 5°f weather at 12:30 in the morning.

The Black Eye Galaxy (also called Evil Eye Galaxy and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) is a relatively isolated spiral galaxy located 17 million light years away in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. It was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier in 1780. A dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus gave rise to its nicknames of the ""Black Eye"" or ""Evil Eye"" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance in small telescopes.

Second, the ""lenses"" (called eyepieces) give you different magnifications, inversely to the focal length. 25mm gives the least magnfication and 4mm the least. The barlow lenses then multiply that up. 

Now the practial part. Magnification is the *least* important thing, quality of the image is much more important. That is determined in the first place, by the air around you (pollution, water vapor and movement, like from air rising from hot chimney vents), in the second place by the aperture of your scope (small in this case) and in the third place by the quality of all the lenses.

How high a magnification you can achieve will depend not so much on the numbers on the lenses but on these three factors.

Out of the box ignore the Barlow lenses. In this grade of telescope they are not of very good quality and will just degrade the image. Also ignore the erector lens, again it is just extra gralss in the way and the Moon doesn't care which way up it is.

With the very small aperture the 4mm will only be usable in exceptional atmospheric conditions, and in any case it is most likely the worst quality of the three eyepieces. 

The best magnification *for this scope* will be from the 12.5mm, but you may find (depending on the conditions) that the 25mm will give you better views on any particular night. Anyway uuse just these two, and try both on any given night.

And preferably take the scope outside rather than using it through an open window (warm air escaping will cause terrible distortions) or through glass.

Third, r/telescopes \- although they will probably tell you to get a Dobsonian (which is a good upgrade one you have the money).",,1577148200,{},fbwf12w,False,t3_eesv56,False,True,t3_eesv56,/r/Astronomy/comments/eesv56/please_help_a_father_in_need_complete_noob/fbwf12w/,1577148201,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The 4mm will likely exceed the telescopes useful magnifying power and it's small exit pupil size and eye relief will make it very difficult to use so I wouldn't use it either.  Just stick with the 25mm and 12.5mm for now.   

It is fortunate that you got this scope for free.  TBH,  scopes such as these are not recommended as a first scope for a beginner, yet most folks get something like this under the guise that they ""don't want to spend too much just to see if they like the hobby or not"".  When in fact, scopes like these usually turn people off to the hobby because the scope is so cheaply made that it is difficult to use and shows poor images of almost anything besides the moon.  Good telescopes are not cheap. A good beginner scope will run you a minimum of $200 which would get you either an AWB Onesky or Sky Watcher Heritage 130.  Just about everything that is on a tripod for under $500 is going to be poor quality.  

My recommendation would be to seek out your local astronomy [club](https://www.astroleague.org/astronomy-clubs-usa-state). They will be your best resource to getting started in the hobby. Most clubs host some kind of public viewing once a month where the public can look through a variety of telescopes and ask the owners questions about them. Many clubs also have spare telescopes members can borrow or check out like a library book that would be orders of magnitude better than what your friend gave you. Some clubs even have a ""junior"" club for school aged kids.  In addition, clubs typically host a monthly meeting where like minded folks can socialize, discuss the latest astronomy news, or invite a speaker to give a presentation on various subject matters. Usually it is during these meetings that the club will also have a new member orientation to talk about what things to look for when buying a scope, etc.   My club has a ""class"" that new members can attend during the monthly meetings where we take new members from knowing nothing to becoming expert observers of the sky and telescope use over the course of a year.  But a word of warning, most club members are elderly retired folks.  I tried to originally join my local club when I was 8 and was turned off because it was ""just a bunch if old folks"". But trust me, these ""old folks"" are a wealth of knowledge and are more than willing to take a newbie under their wing and show them the ropes.",,1577148148,{},fbweyld,False,t3_eesv56,False,True,t3_eesv56,/r/Astronomy/comments/eesv56/please_help_a_father_in_need_complete_noob/fbweyld/,1577148149,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The Orion Nebula is a massive cloud of gas and dust around 1,300 light years from Earth and is located in the constellation of Orion. It is around 25 light years across and is the closest star forming region to Earth. Located 1,600 light-years away from Earth, the Running Man Nebula, vaguely resembles a colorful space ghost sprinting through the stars in the Orion constellation. The Horsehead Nebula is thought to be around 3 to 4 light years tall and 2 to 3 light years across. The Horsehead Nebula will eventually disperse due to ultra violet light from nearby stars evaporating its gas cloud. The Flame Nebula is about 900 to 1,500 light years away. The bright star Alnitak, the easternmost star in the Belt of Orion, shines energetic ultraviolet light into the Flame and this knocks electrons away from the great clouds of hydrogen gas that reside there.

It is around 25 light years across and is the closest star forming region to Earth. Located 1,600 light-years away from Earth, the Running Man Nebula, vaguely resembles a colorful space ghost sprinting through the stars in the Orion constellation.

This is obviously not easy to do when telescope time is scheduled out and everyone wants to use them for their own experiments. It's become more elegant these days than just a person comparing two images, but I believe that's still the general concept to spotting new asteroids. There are some telescopes dedicated to identifying and tracking these objects but it's a really, really big sky.

These are relatively small objects and are very difficult to spot, so we miss *most* asteroids and some large ones (as in hundreds of meters... not the size of Texas like in Armageddon...) haven't been noticed until after they've passed or right before their closest approach. The trouble are the resources it would take for anywhere close to adequate coverage, and we've only just begun our very first mission as humanity to redirect an asteroid, but to use that technique we need to spot it early. For asteroids which we don't know exist or for which their orbital trajectories are uncertain, there's not much we can do. More money should be spent on tracking space debris and hazards, but the fact is it incidents happen so rarely and close calls happen so often people are normalized to it.

A giant asteroid on a collision course with the planet is a fairly black and white affair. We can calculate with considerable accuracy precisely what the effects would be, including a rough death toll.

So in that case, you almost wouldn't even need the governments to do anything except get the fuck out of the way while various enterprises spent money on dealing with the problem.

The electron-degenerate core is quite a long way below the photosphere, so doesn't particularly matter near the ""surface"". The ions in the core solidify after several Gyr of cooling, though the atmosphere remains as a gas/plasma. So if you were for some reason indestructible, you would certainly be inside the white dwarf before you reached any solid surface (and only for those with crystallised cores).

What the surface looks like depends on whether it is convective or radiative (much like main sequence stars). Convection reaches the surface as white dwarfs cool, but does so at a higher temperatures (less time spent cooling) if the atmosphere is helium-dominated rather than hydrogen-dominated. Therefore the main thing you'd see in these cases are convection cells. The size of the cells depends on the temperature and the white dwarf mass. Convection cells mean surface won't be completely flat -- I'm not completely certain on the cell height, but I imagine it'll be similar to the pressure scale height which varies from a few metres to a few hundred metres depending on temperature, composition and surface gravity.

I frequently see something similar to what you're describing.  I live near a major airport almost in-line with the landing pattern.  Sometimes, planes lined up in the distance appear pretty bright but they're so far away they don't look like they're moving.  You have to watch them for a few minutes to notice any movement.  You also don't see the red and green lights or flickering.  They look like Venus or Jupiter sometimes.

You say that you looked away, then when you looked back they were gone.  How long did you look away?

6590,[],,AlphaBetaParkingLot,,,[],,,,text,t2_4waqb,False,False,[],"As another person pointed out, the sun does emits light at many wavelengths (colors), and this combination of different colors across the color spectrum is by definition white light. If you want the specifics, the sun emits light as a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) of 5800K.

As for why it appears different colors.

**White in space:** This is the sun seen ""raw"", unfiltered by the Earth's atmosphere, so it appears white as explained above

**Blue in afternoon:** I don't know what you mean, the sun looks close to white perhaps slight yellow tint when high in the sky, but also don't look at it then because you can go blind. Anyway, the sun is being scattered by the earth's atmosphere, but not very much, as there is only like 10-20 miles of dense atmosphere for it to go through. This filtering/scattering is called [Raleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering)

**orange during sunset:** Same answer as above, except instead of looking though 10-20 miles of atmosphere you are looking through 500+ miles of atmosphere, so the effect of [Rayleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) is far greater, and in short scatters the blue end of the spectrum, leaving red to reach your eyes and make the sun appear red.

**Yellow through telescope:** You are probably referring to the view of the sun through a solar telescope with a Hydrogen-Alpha (H-alpha) filter, which allows you to see solar flares, prominences, and other things in amazing detail. You can also get a *Baader* filter, which makes the sun appear white, and allows great viewing of sunspots.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** The apparent color of the sun depends on how much atmosphere you are looking though, with a redder color for more atmosphere due to [Rayleigh Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering).

The light it produces is, indeed, white, although it emits the wavelength for green the most. During noon, the sun is closest to the earth with respect to the observer, as compared to sunset or sunrise when it is farthest. Try to imagine the horizon if its unclear. 
This change in distance alters the light that reaches you. Since red light is scattered the least due to the large wavelength, it alone reaches your eyes over large distances such as those it needs to cover during sunrise and sunset. At noon, yellow is much more visible. 

As for the telescope, I have no explanation. I'm just a high school physics student and this is my understanding. Would love to know if I'm incorrect!

As for the largest solar radii, because stars are so far away, while we can get a very good estimate range, we can't calculate their exact radii. The very largest stars in size are high-mass; unstable; dying stars called red supergiants, as well as their even larger; less stable; more luminous versions, the red hypergiants. Currently the contenders for the largest star in terms of size are UY Scuti, WOH G64, Westerlund 1-26, and VY Canis Majoris

In terms of mass, the highest mass stars (and also the hottest), are actually much smaller in size than even smaller red supergiants, but they are still absolute giants compared to our Sun. The highest mass stars ussually fall into one three categories of hot; luminous; star: wolf-rayets, blue hypergiants, or LBVs (luminous blue variables). The majority of the higher mass stars ussually range 25 to 80 times the mass of our sun, but some can get much, much larger. Eta Carinae A is somewhere between 90-150 solar masses (depending on the estimate), and the star with the highest known mass in the universe, R136A1, has a mass over 300 times that of the Sun's. There are two primary hypotheses on how the highest mass stars form. The first is that they go through normal star formation, but once they ignite into a star they never go through the normal main sequence phase of hydrogen to helium burning like most stars do, and instead they immediatley become a post-main sequence class of unstable star. The other is that two already unusally massive O-type main sequence stars may collide with each other, and the collective mass allows them to become these incredibly massive stars. However billions and billions and billions of years ago, very soon after the Big Bang and its aftermath, the first stars ignited. These stars would have almost certainly been incredibly massive, and may have reached masses of near 1,000x that of the Sun. As you might expect, they were probably blue with light peaks in the UV; very hot; unimaginably lumnious; and so short lived that they probably lived, died, and went supernova within only a few hundreds of thousands of years.",,1577037045,{},fbqym2a,False,t3_ee62jk,False,True,t3_ee62jk,/r/Astronomy/comments/ee62jk/what_is_the_highest_possible_mass_radius_and/fbqym2a/,1577040231,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,1577037881.0,,[],

**Márohu and Boinayel, the star and exoplanet that puts the Dominican Republic on the astronomical map**

The fact that the Dominican Republic has managed to have two stars named after Taino culture in the universe places the country in the stratosphere, in the world astronomical map.

And this has been a feat achieved by a group of researchers, including journalist Marvin del Cid of Diario Libre, archaeologist and speleologist Domingo Abreu Collado and Mayté Vásquez, national coordinator at the IAU (International Astronomical Union).

The news was known this Tuesday morning, which immediately became a national joy, because now, officially a star and an exoplanet bear the names of two Taino deities: Márohu is the star and Boinayel the exoplanet.

The proposal was presented to the AIU by the journalist Marvin del Cid and in a short time it won the interest of the scientists, to become the winner of such initiative.

I see it and I don't even believe it

For Marvin del Cid, a journalist from Diario Libre who proposed the names, now official, of the new stars of the universe, having seen the proposal sent to the IAU come true is like a dream come true.

""I received the pleasant surprise that the names I proposed were the chosen ones. It's like I don't believe it yet. Maybe for many people this doesn't have so much meaning, but to know that as long as we are what we are as a civilization, that star and that planet are going to be called as I proposed, officially, for the whole world"", he says with his characteristic humility.

He commented that the idea arose when he attended to support Diario Libre's collaborators Henry Hidalgo and Darío Martínez to record a podcast they have in the newspaper, and that they had invited a member of the Dominican Astronomical Society (Astrodom), precisely to talk about the names of the new objects in the universe.

""When they started talking about that contest, I remembered the work I had done for Diario Libre about Márohu and Boinayel in the Cueva del Puente, and when I saw that they were two names (a star and a planet) and they were two characters that were closely related like the god of rain and the god of wind, and that are also embodied in the Cueva del Puente, I decided to investigate and present the proposal,"" he said.

Then he added: ""I want to thank Diario Libre for having published the article; Domingo Abreu Collado, because he was the one who rediscovered that cave that Fray Ramón Pané captured in the 16th century and 500 years later he found it. To Emilia Pereyra, who was the one who took me with Domingo to know the cave; to Luigi Morales, who was my second chamber; to Héctor Vilorio, who flew the drone inside the cave; to Henry and Darío; and to Mayté Vásquez, who is the link between Astrodom and the IAU, with which we have been able to put the country on the map of astronomy, which is very important"".

An incentive to research

For Mayté Vásquez, who is national coordinator at the IAU, it was very important as a nation to choose a Taino name, because this year is the International Year of Indigenous Languages, through UNESCO, and the IAU wanted it to be combined with what is being celebrated.

""With this, we had the opportunity to do it, the country was giving us the opportunity to choose Taino names because of our roots,"" he said.

And, he added: ""I think this is an incentive for young researchers and this is an achievement that shows that you can go one step higher and that's what the IAU was looking for in naming these objects.

NGC 7380 is an open cluster discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1787. Located 7200 light years away, the Wizard Nebula surrounds the developing open star. The interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional medieval sorcerer. The active star forming region spans about 100 light years.

This animation consists of 37 frames running at 5fps. Most of the combining was done in increments of 20 raw images (some were shorter increments) ending at 560 total (each raw image had a 30 second exposure time).

NGC 7380 is an open cluster discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1787.  Located 7200 light years away, the Wizard Nebula surrounds the developing open star.  The interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional medieval sorcerer. The active star forming region spans about 100 light years.

This was an outreach event at my old university, and I was able to hook up my camera to a 16"" telescope.

I know very little about planets. The affect of  Sgr A*'s previous epochs of activity would have on Galactic habitability has been studied a little. The main discussion is about if the ultraviolet would remove atmospheres. I can point you at references, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement. It's safe to say the Sun's position is probably a safe distance, but that may not be true if the AGN orientated in the direction of the Sun.

In a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent lifeforms--the cheela--living on Dragon's Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time, men are their diligent teachers.

One month ago I went to Cerro Catedral to try some tracked photos of the Orion constellation. It's the highest point in Uruguay with a modest altitude of 514 meters. I wanted to test for the first time my recently h-alpha modified x-t30.

**Equipment details**

\- Fujifilm x-t30a

\- Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer Tracker

\- Fujifilm 50mm 2.0

**Capture**

40 Lights x 120 sec exposures at Iso 1600 and 2.8 aperture

**Stacking**

I used Starry Sly Stacker to stack the images.

**Post Processing**

Most post processing was done on Photoshop and only used Pixinsight for background extraction and color balance. On photoshop I’ve used star reduction, curves, levels, contrast and color balance

Capella , designated α Aurigae (Latinized to Alpha Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega. A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning ""little goat"" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at 42.9 light-years (13.2 pc) from the Sun.

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L.

The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun.

***

**Regulus**

Regulus UK:  US: , designated α Leonis (Latinized to Alpha Leonis, abbreviated Alpha Leo, α Leo), is the brightest object in the constellation of Leo and one of the brightest stars in the night sky, lying approximately 79 light years from the Sun. Regulus appears singular, but is actually a quadruple star system composed of four stars that are organized into two pairs. The spectroscopic binary Regulus A consists of a blue-white main-sequence star and its companion, which has not yet been directly observed, but is probably a white dwarf. HD 87884 is separated from Regulus by 176″ and is itself a close pair.

***

**Gamma Leonis**

Gamma Leonis (γ Leonis, abbreviated Gamma Leo, γ Leo), formally named Algieba , is a binary star system in the constellation of Leo. In 2009, a planetary companion around the primary was announced.

Mizar and Alcor are two stars forming a naked eye double in the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) asterism in the constellation of Ursa Major.  Mizar is the second star from the end of the Big Dipper's handle, and Alcor its fainter companion. The traditional name Mizar derives from the Arabic المئزر miʼzar meaning 'apron; wrapper, covering, cover'. 

Alcor was originally Arabic سها‎ Suhā/Sohā, meaning either the ‘forgotten’ or ‘neglected’ one; notable as a faintly perceptible companion of Mizar.

7367,[],,Adonidis,,,[],,,,text,t2_hgm66,False,False,[],"""Rubin’s most important scientific contribution was establishing that the orbiting speeds of gas clouds in the outer parts of galaxies remain constant (i.e., “flat”) to distances well beyond the visible starlight, rather than declining as in the outer parts of our Solar System. High orbital speeds in the outer parts of galaxies imply the existence of extra matter at large radii. As a result of Rubin’s work and later studies, we now know that galaxies are surrounded by enormous invisible halos of matter containing 5/6 of the mass and extending ten times farther out than the visible regions. Numerous arguments show that this so-called “dark matter” must be fundamentally different from the ordinary, “baryonic” matter of the periodic table. Its nature is still unknown but is being pursued in numerous experiments in particle accelerators and particle detectors around the world. The realization that baryonic matter is only a trace component of the Universe revealed our understanding of the cosmos as shockingly incomplete and was one of the milestones that ushered in the era of modern cosmology.

Rubin’s second major scientific breakthrough, from about the same era, was a study of the Galaxy’s motion with respect to cosmic rest (Rubin, Thonnard, Ford, and Roberts, Astronomical Journal, 81, 719, 1976). At that time, it was widely believed that the expansion of the Universe was smooth and regular with deviations of individual galaxies of order 50 km s-1. Rubin and collaborators undertook to measure the peculiar motion of our Local Group of galaxies with respect to a shell of 96 spiral galaxies that were so distant they were plausibly at rest with respect to the rest of the Universe. The motion that they found, 454±125 km s-1, was nearly ten times larger than the standard value and was viewed as by some as cosmic heresy. Subsequent studies demonstrated that such studies are in fact highly complex, and this first value obtained by Rubin and colleagues is only marginally consistent with later values. Nevertheless, their paper boldly opened the subject, and large irregularities in the cosmic expansion are now part of standard cosmic lore. Indeed, they are induced by the much greater masses of superclusters of galaxies due to their large dark matter components.""

While the seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth, the *length* of a season depends on the orbit's eccentricity.

The Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud. Some astrophysicists theorize that a small black hole exists in the middle of the core, also known as the Trapezium. Many of the filamentary structures visible in the featured image are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun. It can be found with the unaided eye just below and to the left of the easily identifiable belt of three stars in the popular constellation Orion. 

The Running Man Nebula, also known as NGC 1977, is also featured and vaguely resembles a colorful space ghost sprinting through the stars.  To see the Running Man, look at the left portion of the image, where dark regions laced with faint red emission from hydrogen atoms loosely carve the shape of an ""X"" inside the blue cloud. That ""X"" forms the running man's arms and legs.

There are some American cultures that I don't go along with. Like dairy and honey for instance.

This is by far my best picture I've ever take so far from a DSO. I remember watching a video from Astrobackyard about the Orion Nebula. After that video I bought a Skywatcher Star Adventurer and used my canon 760d with an old canon 18-55 kit lens. The first frame was a 30 second iso 3200 f5,8 and when I saw the frame for the first time I almost screamed. The downside was that this was at the end of winter when the nebula already was close to the horizon at it's highest point. 


Now almost a year later I made this one. This image is take from data that I captured over several nights five to be precise. I'm having trouble getting longer exposures than ~20 seconds at the moment while just a couple of months ago I got around 120-130 seconds with the same equipment. My polar aligment is fine for as far as I can see, it's correctly balanced and the tripod is level. The reticle is in the center of the scope, I checked this by centering it on a streetlight during the day while rotating the RA Axis. The clutches are all tight and the motor isn't spinning faster or slower than it should be. I checked this by setting it up at the side of the desk and letting it run for 24 hours recording its start and the end position. A friend of mine suggested opening the mount and grease the gears a bit. Another thing I noticed is that the DSO seems to move quite a bit while scrolling fast trough the frames. It's like at one point the mount thinks that's it's behind and needs to keep up, and the next frame it thinks it's infront and needs to slow down again. I know it's supposed to do this a bit, but I think it's a bit to much movement.



Anyways, I used the following equipment:

Canon 760D

ISO 200

Skywatcher Star Adventure

Skywatcher evostar 72ed 420mm f5,8

823 times 20 seconds light frames.

80 dark frames

80 flat frames

80 bias frames


Processing details:

I started with manually going through every frame and deleting the ones with star trailing, comets, satellites, clouds, etc. After that I started stacking them in DeepSkyStacker 4.2.2 with the suggested setting. This took a long time because of the 1063 frames. After it finished stacking I exported it as a 32 bit rational and imported it in Adobe Photoshop CC 2019.

I started with a threshold layer to see with what kind of data I was working with and set a dark point for background calibration. After the threshold layer I picked a bright star and started adjusting the colors so all the colors where at the same value +- 3. The next thing was cropping the image to frame the nebula in the center and removing stacking artifacts at the corner. Before I start cropping I changed the image to 16 bit, after that I did an extreme curve stretch to brighten the corners so I know how far I needed to crop the image. After the crop I removed the curve stretch and opened s new curve adjustment layer, with this layer I started bringing the nebula forward while keeping a correct color balance. I did this about 9 times until I got the nebula quite how I like it. After these 9 curve stretches I tried bringing the faint nebulosity forward by editing each color individually. The next thing was a star minimize and some noise removal. The last thing I did was removing the blue/purple hallos around some star with the lens correction feature in the camera raw filter.",,1576537921,{},fb5zvaj,True,t3_ebmw5d,False,True,t3_ebmw5d,/r/Astronomy/comments/ebmw5d/the_mighty_orion_nebula/fb5zvaj/,1576537923,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

Usually these are terrible oversimplifications.  I don't know if you play tabletop RPGs but their rules are also horrible about this kind of thing.  There are too many factors determining visibility.  In addition to distance there is brightness, and different people have different sensitivity that can double or half the range at which one can see an object of a particular brightness.  This obscuring dust is something you can see.  If you get to dark skies and look at the center of the Milky Way (in Sagittarius) when it is high enough to see the whole thing, you will notice that the center is irregular and dark.  This is the dust.  But of course, you can see farther above and below the dust lane, which functions just like a terrestrial cloud blocking part of the sky.  As for things like the Andromeda Galaxy, now you are getting the benefit of it being out in a direction where there is not sufficient dust to block the light much, and in addition, the stars appear so close together at that distance that each photoreceptor in our eyes is picking up light from many stars, and their combined brightness is enough to see.

Starting around the invention of the telescope (late 1500s and after) an effort was made to catalog stars. Several systems were developed.  Bayer used Greek letters followed by the constellation name (Alpha Centauri). John Flamsteed used a # followed by the constellation name (55 Cancri).  There were several others but those two are the most common we still see in use. Those systems can overlap and a [star have names in all three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Orion): Rigel is also Beta Orionis and 19 Orionis. The brighter the star the more likely it has multiple designations. 

As equipment got even better we surpassed any system using simple numbers and letters and newer catalogs (Henry Draper or HD) and satellites like Hipparchos use large numbers like 24436 to designate Rigel. Seeing a reference to an HD ### star is not uncommon since that catalog covered 225,300 stars. Eventually even these systems exceeded capacity and even more distant starts are often just referred to by designation which reference their place in the Celestial coordinate system: [WISE J0521+1025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISE_J0521%2B1025) and whatever survey recorded it.

As far as galaxies their names didn't start until a few hundred years later. The first major system we use is Messier Catalog of objects. These were object he recorded while looking for comets that weren't comets but could be confused with one. His objects are M# like M31 for the Andromeda Galaxy or M42 for the Orion Nebula.  No distinction is made between types, he didn't have the capability to determine if an object was a galaxy, cluster or nebula. After Messier the next most common catalog of deep sky objects is the [New General Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalogue) which produces NGC numbers like NGC 1976 for the Orion Nebula. A number of the objects in both catalogs (which overlap) have common names.

As you get into more obscure objects there are specific catalogs that have been compiled. For example the [Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_Catalog_of_Planetary_Nebulae) or the [Bernard Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_Catalogue) or dark nebula. 

Even these no longer suffice and again for more distant galaxies and we have fallen into more obscure systems of based on location, catalog, type of object and other factors that often take looking up in the specific catalogs reference portion to determine how the name was arrived at.

No one is quite sure what the core of a neutron star is made of, but there are some theories it might be composed of an exotic substance known as strange matter. Some theories further suggest that if strange matter came into contact with the normal matter that dust clouds, galaxies, stars, planets, life, and you and me are made of, that it our matter would naturally react with that strange matter, to become more like it, and like a virus, strange matter could spread to everything and destroy it.

Saturn has a magnitude of 0.4 which would produce the bright image here.  The points of light around the body in the center could be Saturnian moons.   The 3 stars to the right appear to be part of Sagittarius so I'm guessing this is an image of Saturn taken this past April.

0 - focus most of your current attention in school on getting good at math.

Now for your questions, by number.  

1 - Yes, but the number of job opportunities is limited.  I switched from pre-med to Astronomy as a sophomore and some people said I was chickening out.  I told then that the entire work force in Astronomy was about the same size as one year's admittance to medical school (I think this was for the whole USA, but I don't remember)  Most jobs are at university or community college, and at university you will do research and also (likely) teaching.  Note also that some things we generally call ""astronomy"" are called something else at some universities, like ""planetary science"" or ""planetary geology"" (which is an oxymoron.)

2 - Plan backwards.  Look up people in what specialties you like, meaning, for example, if your thing is black holes, research the people who are responsible for the articles you have been reading about that subject.  Find out where they went to **graduate school**.   (Nearly all working astronomers have a PhD.)  You will find that they did not all go to schools you have heard about like CalTech or MIT.  Now, look up those graduate schools and figure out what their entrance requirements are.  What percentage of applicants do they take?  (And so on.)  Now, make note of this most important fact: **a lot of graduate schools do not take people from their own university**.  So if you find out that your ideal grad school is the University of Arizona, don't apply to the University of Arizona as an undergraduate.  Pick a place that will get you the background you need to get there as a graduate student.  Once you have some ideas about schools for your undergraduate degree, write to their admissions department and ask what they want in their ideal freshman.  That then becomes a goal of your **current plan**.   

3 - Very few high schools have astronomy as a subject.  The best you will likely get is physics.  Now I taught astronomy at a private high school - I know it can happen - but it is rare.  As I said above, your primary focus now should be math, as much as possible, and getting a high enough overall GPA and SAT reading score that it doesn't keep you out of the university you want.  Take the physics course if they have it, and do so as late as possible so you have as much math as you can get first.  You'll retake it in college unless you can get AP physics, but having that not be your first pass is always good.  

4 - This depends on what your interests are.  See if you can figure out what attracted you to astronomy?  Is there common ground in geology?  Physics itself?  (Most practical astronomy is physics applied to an astronomy problem.)   There are a lot of other jobs that use these skills, so getting the degree will not hurt you, but that's a decision that is well down the road.  Never give up on your dreams until you have to.

It will not ""shut down professional surface astronomy""

As an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer, I have actually taken the time to research this.

Sure, it will create extra steps, the frames with streaks in them will have to discarded.

Worse case scenario,, we just have to take more frames.

But you have to weigh the benefits.

We are talking about high speed Internet everywhere in the world.

Right now we have over 5 million cell towers around the world.

We have fiber cables running through the oceans and across the world all causing a massive impact on our environment.

Without SpaceX satellites, we will need to drastically increase the number of cell towers and cables to make Internet accessible to the remaining 5 billion people that don't have it now, increasing drastically the environmental impact.

The SpaceX satellites will have zero effect on our environment and will provide Internet to 5 billion people that do not currently have Internet access.

This is an enormous benefit in exchange for discarding frames with streaks in them.

I use to feel the same way, that it would ruin the night sky, but then I did the research and found out - actually not really.

Parker Solar Probe (previously Solar Probe, Solar Probe Plus, or Solar Probe+, abbreviated PSP) is a NASA robotic spacecraft launched in 2018, with the mission of repeatedly probing and making observations of the outer corona of the Sun. It will approach to within 9.86 solar radii (6.9 million kilometers or 4.3 million miles) from the center of the Sun and by 2025 will travel, at closest approach, as fast as 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph), or 0.064% the speed of light.The project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year. The cost of the project is US$1.5 billion. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory designed and built the spacecraft, which was launched on August 12, 2018.

So for this we're looking mostly at the models, we have some measurements over time from our orbiters and some limited measurements of extrasolar gas giants and generally they don't change a whole lot on the available timescales.

You would have tidal forces with the moons and internal tides causing the body of the gas to bulge in certain areas which would be more susceptible to wearing off in the solar wind. That is a mechanism that will gradually erode the mass of the gas giant.

A few things could add mass to the planet, like entry of asteroids and meteors into the gas giant body. Those things would most likely fall to the core and add to the total mass, but wouldn't occur very often unless something super disruptive happened to mix the existing contents of the solar system.

If things remain stable over the long term, the planet would eventually go one of two ways to die off before the parent star.

You could have the gas erode completely, potentially leaving behind a core if there's anything left after sublimation. That core would then experience its own aging and decay on its own timeline.

You could also have the planetary system be disrupted enough to send gas giants colliding and merging. With enough mass - probably more than is in our gas giants total - you would begin to see stellar ignition and a second star could form. Systems like this exist and have been imaged by Hubble and other similar projects.

The decay of these planets if left undisturbed is very slow, this is compared to the timeline of the star expanding and eating many of the inner planets. If the star goes as far as to expand and does not eat the gas giants, they will experience much more intense solar wind due to now being much closer - and the decay rate will also change. As will the tidal pull of the star on the gas, further accelerating decay of the atmosphere.

A planet with no atmosphere or leftover gas giant core can outlive its star by a lot if it's still far away, it's decay rate on its own is very very slow. The irradiation of a closer red giant surface would make the planet more radioactive overall, accelerating the nuclear decay rate of the rock materials. Rocky planets would need to be melted and boiled to decay before the star, which is possible if the surface of the star is close enough to the planet surface.

Given the relative sizes of our planets and star, it would seem we would need many more gas giants to light a second sun. And if we did, things in our solar system would rearrange in a chaotic period then slowly settle into a new organization.

Planets can outlive their stars, we may have gotten pluto and the other outermost planets from other systems!

Sometimes the Sun's surface becomes a whirlwind of activity. Hot plasma is seen swirling over the solar limb in an ongoing battle between changing magnetic fields and constant gravity. Energetic events like this are becoming less common as the Sun nears a minimum in its 11-year activity cycle. This was captured in 2018.

First, each body in orbit around a thing has a measure called ""eccentricity,"" or how elliptical the orbital path of said body is. 

Most of the major bodies in the solar system trace a *near* perfect circle, but there is still a non-zero eccentricity. 

Here's a handy table: https://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm

The measure of eccentricity goes from 0-1. 0 being a perfect circle, 1 being a highly elliptical orbit. 

As for Earth's tilt, it is not perfect either. The pole will trace a circle over a long period of time (centuries). This means our North Star, Polaris, wasn't always our North Star. Nor will it be in the future. Essentially, the Earth has a bit of a wobble in its rotation.

Hope this helps!

EDIT: I should also add that the eccentricity of Earth's orbit does NOT cause the seasons. The tilt of the Earth does.

This is mostly because we aren't able to directly measure most things about these planets like their inner composition and core size and density etc. But there's still quite a bit we can do, because the development is still constrained by familiar physics in the same universe, same star system no less. With that plus the measurements we have taken by sending robotic probes out into space, we can use models to do some informed guesswork. 

A few things that we do know from probes and pictures: our gas giant planets spin, and sometimes on unusual axes or very quickly compared to our planet and sun; the top layers of some planets rotate in bands with widely different rotational speeds; these planets have orbiting moons that can be made of gas ices or rocky materials - one of which shoots out water geisers into space periodically; these planets have familiar gasses in their visible top layers we can identify using spectroscopy; these planets have magnetic fields that also interact with solar wind - meaning that they develop partly by action of the sun's rays and particles; these planets tend to have relatively very thin and flat gas ice rings extending far out into space (they aren't exactly flat - robotic probe) and some more stuff

So, we can add some of bernoullis principle and gravitational models of free gaseous particles in open space, factor in the solar wind and presence of other materials needed to form the other planets, and place it in the space of our own galaxy rewound some four and a half billion years and you get approximately this for a timeline of gaseous planet development:

Free particles in space, grouping at solar system scale due to mostly gravitational forces at work between adjacent particles causing clumps of ever larger scale until other forces take over. Mainly informed by closest stars reasonably far away - minute forces overall allowing microgravity to dictate movement. Made of hydrogen and helium and a small amount of denser stuff from nearby supernovas

Local macrogravitational forces take over from microgravity and the big clump defining the middle of the solar system begins collapsing into a star as gravitational forces approach then meet then exceed nuclear forces keeping atoms separate in the centers of clumps.

Fusion occurs at first chaotically as smaller pockets reach fusion conditions before their surroundings. Solar wind begins slowly and chaotically, mixing the surrounding soup of particles. 

Gradually the particles continue to unite as initiating and newly fusing clumps, slowly forming the big clump that will become our star. Some fusion reactions spark others, or blow them out. It's messy for a while as things get going, the heat agitates the particles and causes more activity overall in the forming system. 

Meanwhile in the surroundings the particle soup continues to swirl about into its own clumps, gradually settling into protoplanet-building rocks and gas pockets. The magnetic fields of the source particles are being informed by the solar wind and galactic forces. Materials settle in the solar wind as if in a liquid, denser to the bottom and lighter to the top - with some kicked to the top such as in boiling water. 

Even up to this point new alien particles can enter the outer regions of the space freely, there is still only microgravity ruling except in the center.

Once the protostar is fully lit, its gravity begins to recede as its temperature and fusion rate increase. It's full of dust still alongside the fusion materials so it's dirty and not fully powerful yet. It ejects this dust in intense solar winds, providing even more heat and charge and mixing force to the surroundings.

The proto planets are forming at this point, clumps of gas mix when they meet in the chaotic soup, and when rocky clumps collide they heat up and may partly melt together in explosive contact. If one is much bigger than the other it may consume the smaller. The direction and speed of the impacts alter the rotation direction and speed of the growing planet.

The star gets cleaner and more fusion occurs, pumping still more pressure into the surroundings. The ejected material rains down on the forming planets and out into distant space

The body of space around the star is chaotic and still itself in mostly free space, giving the overall body the ability to rotate freely on its own axis. Due to natural variations in the mix, an average bulk rotation develops that also dictates the outgoing pressure of solar wind, causing the star to rotate alongside the surrounding bulk.  Rotations continue to develop at the planet and moon scale, inside of the bulk rotation. Gravity begins constraining the plane of rotation. 

The rocky proto planets are now large enough to collapse surrounding meteors, causing intense growth and heating and accelerated rotation. The quickly growing gravity of these planets begins to affect further and further objects. We suspect that one was a nearby proto planet that was drawn to the molten early Earth to collide and expel the molten blob that would become our moon.

From there as the surface cooled it ceased boiling and expelling liquids and gasses from the particle soup, and they collect on the planet surface. They provide tidal forces that gradually pushed the moon away to the distance we now see.

The gas planets would collect the same particle soup as the rocky planets, just according to what particles were local to the formation of the planets. The solar wind would push more gasses out than rocks, so the gas giants likely formed where the gasses naturally settled between solar wind outward pressure and gravity inward pressure. They could have rocky centers inclusive of both familiar rocks and solid gasses. The moons could be clumped asteroids that entered the gravity of the growing planet, eventually getting big enough to collapse the bulk into a few larger bodies.

From there, the planets continued to collect gasses gradually clearing out the empty space of the solar system in cooperation with the solar wind. Their rotation likely informed by how the clumps all joined together, from what direction and speed etc.

As they age they develop the magnetic fields of the composing materials, interact tidally with their moons and more distant objects like the asteroid belt, and deflect/mix with the solar wind. Being partly in the shadow of the solar wind from a more inward planet would very very slightly change the acceleration pressure from the shaded side of the planet via bernoillis principle, partly informing the rotations of the planets behind solar gravity and local forces. 

Within the gas giants we would expect precipitation and clouds and other familiar gaseous movement, because they are the same gasses as we have just much more and in a different mix. You might be able to float an airship for instance, if you adjusted for the density of the gas and the movement. You might see solid gas precipitation near the core, from gravity compressing already dense gasses. If you could add enough mass to a planet like that, you may turn it into a protostar - given the right combination and types of gasses and a lot of material. 

And that brings us to today, with our group of odd planets with odd angles and speeds of rotation, familiar far away gasses, magnetic fields extending into space, planes of rotation, and a sun of comparable ballpark age to the solar system

For example, in roughly three billion years our sun will evolve to the next stage of its lifecycle and become a red giant. This phase will increase the radius of the sun to extreme sizes (it will potential consume the orbit of the earth). In this case the planets will likely be destroyed when colliding with the hot gas from the sun).  However some planets can survive this phase but eventually much of the mass from the sun will leave the system in the form of winds and all that will remain is a white dwarf. If any planets survive this dynamic transition without being gravitationally flung from the system then they could potentially orbit the white dwarf and continue to survive. However, the white dwarf will not be putting out nearly as much light and thus the planets will become very cold.

 In the case of systems with stars much more massive than our sun, the planets will likely be destroyed in the supernova explosion at the end of that stars life or the resulting black hole.

If you’d like to nerd out for a moment, here is an explanation of what you are seeing...

This sequence begins as the moon is deep within the Earth’s shadow.   At this point, the ruddy “blood moon” is very dimly lit by sunlight refracted (bent) through Earth’s atmosphere.    I snapped a frame every 10 seconds.  Notice how the movement of the moon is apparent relative to the background stars!   

As the Moon escapes Earth’s umbral shadow, the scene is flooded with reflected sunlight.   The moon quickly transitions from a crescent phase, back to full.   The edge of this shadow allows us to observe the curvature of the Earth. 

From the rear camera, you can see the action of the tracking mount turning opposite the Earth’s rotation.   You may even notice my arm reaching in to adjust the exposure on the fly ... trying to keep the scene properly exposed.   The clouds flying through made consistency a rather futile effort.

Both were shot on DSLR cameras and lenses, no telescopes were harmed in the making of this video.   The eclipse is from Sept 27, 2015.  One of the cool things about astrophotography is you can always revisit your earlier work when you learn new tricks.

**True color [(static image)](https://i.imgur.com/y0XejJw.jpg)**

When imaging deep space objects, we tend to put filters in front of our cameras to only let in a very specific wavelength of light. When we are looking to create a true color image, those filters are red, green, and blue (R, G, B). We take these hours of data captured over many nights to create a single final image. With this, we can then color calibrate the image. You might be wondering how we do this, since with many normal photographs, we can just color calibrate by eye. There are many databases out there with thousands and thousands of star values for color, we actually use these to color calibrate our image. After completing color calibration, the final step is to stretch the image. In very simple terms, this simply means to brighten the image. After stretching, I did not do any further adjustments to keep it as minimally edited as possible. What makes it nearly entirely red though? That is the emission of hydrogen. With hydrogen being the most abundant element in the nebulae, and most nebulae, almost all of them appear to be red. 

So now you might be asking yourself, if this is true color, would it be what I see if I were just in a spaceship floating in space? The answer is no. That is simply because our eyes are not bright enough to see the color on many of these objects. For example, if you go into your room wearing a red shirt and turn all the lights off, what color is your shirt you can no longer see? Is it black, or is it red? Clearly your shirt is still red, it is just too dark for you to see. But you might be thinking if you were closer, it would be brighter, right? Not really. As you get closer to these objects, they get larger, which offsets the brightness gains. The way I like to think of this is with the Milky Way. We are *in* the Milky Way, we physically can't get closer to it, yet it still looks nothing like images of it. 

**False color [(static image)](https://i.imgur.com/1SAK3sR.jpg)** 

Similar to the true color image, are false color image uses filters that are made to look at specific wavelengths. However, in this case we are looking for specific wavelengths based on excitation of different elements (Sulfur II, Hydrogen α, and Oxygen III). These elements all have very precise emission wavelengths, so we can use filters to only let their light through and block unwanted source such as light pollution or moonlight. [Here](https://starizona.com/acb/ccd/advimages/Narrowband%20Diagram.jpg) is a chart that shows where they each lie in the visible spectrum. With this in mind, we assign Sii to red, Hα to green, and Oiii to blue. Since hydrogen is by far the most dominant gas, we then remove the green from the image. This leaves us with areas where the green and red have mixed (gold), and green and blue (cyan). Not only do many find this to be a relatively pleasing color, but it also allows us to see areas with high sulfur content, and areas with higher oxygen content rather than a giant mass of hydrogen. Whenever you see images of nebulae that are colors other than nearly all red, it is most likely a false colored image. 

**TL;DR** - True color images use RGB filters and are color calibrated using stars, false color images show us compositional differences throughout the nebulae. Both are real images entirely in the visible spectrum

* [Created Ha emission image using this guide](http://www.arciereceleste.it/tutorial-pixinsight/cat-tutorial-eng/85-enhance-galaxy-ha-eng)

***HaRGB***

* ChannelCombination R + G + B
* Combined emission into HaRGB using guide above
* BackgroundNeutralization
* ColorCalibration 
* Inverted SCNR to biggest star as it had magenta halo due to some color lopsidedness other stars have as well
* SCNR green
* MMT using 7 layers with adaptive setting and inverted luminance mask
* HistogramTransformation to taste
* Curves Transformation for contrast and saturation

***L***

* Deconvolution, no deringing support, add non deconvolved stars back using PixelMath and mask
* TGVDenoise
* HistogramTransformation
* LocalHistogramEqualization
* HDRMultiscaleTransform to reduce glow of the core
* MultiscaleLinearTransform with Bias in first 2 layers, for sharperning

***LRGB***

* LRGBCombination
* Curves Transformation for contrast and saturation
* SCNR green
* Star reduction using Morphological Transformation
* Inverted SCNR to stars, to reduce lopsided colors a bit
* ICCProfileTransformation assign sRGB profile

Its not hard to fake things in this day and age.  If i wanted to i could create an identical effect in Windows movie maker in an hours tops.  

Secondly, think *critically* for a moment.  Why in gods name would CNN place a subliminal message in the middle of a new broadcast for some unspecified celestial event?  Why would they say ""alert"", but then also attempt to hide the message?  An exact time of the event was given, a time that has great significance in our calendar but has absolutely no significance in the grand scheme of things, so one can assume that the warning isn't for a natural event like Betelgeuse going Supernova as some people have suggested.  Thus we must ask, what UNnatural event might it be?  Aliens?  Time Travellers?  God himself?  

Why the *fuck* would CNN be in direct contact with aliens, time travellers, and/or god?  If these speculative beings placed the message there themselves, why hasn't CNN made a statement about it?  If this really did get broadcasted live, then why isn't EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD making a statement about it?  Why isn't everyone in the world talking about a major american news broadcaster broadcasting a subliminal message, implying fore-knowledge of a major, unnatural celestial event, possibly implying the existence of time travel, aliens, or gods?

*****
&gt; The two supermassive black holes are orbiting each other, and at the same time, each is exerting its own pull on the stars around it.

&gt; The gravitational forces from the black holes pull on these stars and make them change their orbit; in other words, after one revolution around the supermassive black hole pair, a star will not go exactly back to the point at which it began.

&gt; Using a well-studied star, called S0-2, which orbits the supermassive black hole that lies at the center of the galaxy every 16 years, we can already rule out the idea that there is a second supermassive black hole with mass above 100,000 times the mass of the Sun and farther than about 200 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth.

There are websites that can be used to view areas of the sky using celestial co-ordinates (i used  [https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl](https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl) ) in a large array of different wavelengths, which i saw was a concern of yours in a previous comment.  

Basically, theres nothing there.  There are stars, but not clusters or anything.  Theres dust in the IR field images, but no Nebulas or anything interesting like that.  There isn't even, like, a single significant star in any of the images.  The one thing that i'd say is unusual is that in the H-Alpha filter image (to clarify, H-Alpha is basically just a very specific wavelength of red light, so anything that appears in an H-Alpha image should also appear in a wider ""Red"" image) has an odd sort of blotch on it, but given that this blotch also doesn't appear in any wide-band red filter image i am gonna ASSUME its an error.  Another piece of evidence for this being an error is that H-Alpha light is generally associated with star formation and incredibly bright, young stars, and there is zero evidence of this in any other image.  

In some of the Gamma images show three clear stars right in the middle of the frame and nothing else, which is a fact that some other people have picked up on, but the fact of the matter is that those Gamma images are only resolved properly right in the middle of the frame, so to only see something in the middle of the frame isn't only not surprising, but its down-right expected.  It would be stranger to see a star off to the side in one of these images, but then it would probably be another error in the capture.  

In conclusion, your previous statement that "" You are missing what our eyes are unable to see unassisted. "", nowadays, is false.  We have the technology to see virtually every wavelength of light, from the highest energy light to radiowaves with wavelengths miles long, so if there was ANYTHING in that part of the sky that was out of the ordinary then we would know.  

I also would feel remiss if i didn't point out that no, Black Holes have never been created in a lab.  When the LHC was first activated there was an *idea* that it *might* be able to create incredibly small, short-lived Black Holes, but since then we now know for sure that it can't and it doesn't.  Also Black Holes and Worm Holes are related in the sense that they're to do with general relativity, but thats about it.  To create either one is a very different prospect; to create a Black Hole you'd just need to create a point of sufficiently dense energy such that it collapses in on itself, and then you're done.  To create a Worm Hole you'd need to keep pouring masses on energy into the system to keep it stable enough to use, which would be a hell of a lot harder.  

And then i feel i should cap this off by saying that the video is obviously not real.

The Lockheed SR-71 ""Blackbird"" is a long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft that was operated by the United States Air Force. It was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s by Lockheed and its Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson was responsible for many of the design's innovative concepts. During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats.

**Hafele–Keating experiment**

The Hafele–Keating experiment was a test of the theory of relativity. In October 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer, took four cesium-beam atomic clocks aboard commercial airliners. They flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks against others that remained at the United States Naval Observatory. When reunited, the three sets of clocks were found to disagree with one another, and their differences were consistent with the predictions of special and general relativity.

***

**Proper time**

In relativity, proper time along a timelike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following that line. It is thus independent of coordinates, and is a Lorentz scalar. The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time. This interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line.

8340,[],,moss-fete,,,[],,,,text,t2_3gfc58ay,False,False,[],"""Paradox"" is a bad name. Think of it more like a common mistake that leads to nonsense results. The nonsense results are paradoxical, hence the name, but that shows that there's a mistake in your math somewhere, not that there's an inherent paradox in the universe.

So, to explain the paradox:

One key principle of relativity is that there is no absolute reference frame. If I'm on a train, I could think of myself as stationary and the world moving behind me, or I could think of the world as stationary and my train moving forward, and the physics should work out exactly the same either way. 

Special relativity is often (over)simplified to say that ""moving objects experience time slower than stationary objects. If I place an extremely precise clock on the [SR-71](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird) and have it do a lap, it will come back reading slightly less time has passed than a clock on earth. (Incidentally, this experiment [has been done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment).)

In the twin paradox, we send one twin to a distant planet and back at near-light speed while the other stays on earth. The twin on earth says 

&gt;""I'm stationary, my sister is moving. Moving observers experience time more slowly, so when my twin comes back, she'll have experienced less time and so be younger.""

But, since there's no absolute stationary reference frame, the twin in the spaceship might just as easily say 

&gt;""I'll set this spaceship as my reference frame. From my point of view, it looks like earth is moving away from me, and then coming back. Since I'm stationary and my brother on earth is moving, he'll have moved and I'll be stationary, so he'll have experienced less time and be younger.""

Obviously, both twins can't be younger than the other, hence the paradox.

The resolution comes from clarifying the second principle from earlier. I don't know a non-technical way to explain it (See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time) wiki article), but essentially it states that while there might not be absolute velocity, there *is* absolute acceleration. The principle that ""moving objects experience time slower"" does not necessarily apply to objects that accelerate or change direction. 

So, the paradox is an error that comes from applying an oversimplification to a situation where it doesn't apply. Nothing more than that.

I hope that helps and is at least a little comprehensible.",,1576169841,{},fakn1vr,False,t3_e9pwz6,False,True,t3_e9pwz6,/r/Astronomy/comments/e9pwz6/my_teachers_confused/fakn1vr/,1576169854,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

The closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time “passes” compared to someone traveling as a slower speed (eg: someone on Earth). 

So if you take two twins, one traveling at Earth speed through space-time and one traveling at 90% of the speed of light, the one on Earth will age normally (to us, on Earth) and the one won’t age as much bc time will have passed more slowly for them. 

Trying to think of an easier way, but imagine you have two rubber bands. One is held without any stretching (space-time on Earth), one is pulled as to 90% stretch (90% speed of light).

If you put a mark at 2in on both bands, when you let go, the one that wasn’t stretched will show the mark at 2in (or close enough), the one that was stretched will show the mark at 0.2in or whatever (math isn’t on my side right now).",,1576169817,{},fakn01b,False,t3_e9pwz6,False,True,t3_e9pwz6,/r/Astronomy/comments/e9pwz6/my_teachers_confused/fakn01b/,1576169828,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

Stars dim quickly with distance; from even 60 light-years away, the Sun would fade to invisibility. Only the most luminous of stars can be seen from greater distance, stars like Deneb (probably 1,500–2,500 light-years away), Eta Carinae (7,500 light-years), and Rho Cassiopeiae (8,000–12,000 light-years). About a couple of dozen in total make that list.

So when you look up at the night you are seeing even the most distant stars in the sky as they were less than 10 millennia ago. Most are closer.

But stars live much, much longer than that. The Sun will continue on as it is now for many billions of years. Even the most luminous stars, which use up their core fuel far more quickly, can live for 1 million years or more. That means the odds of a star happening to die while its light is already on its way to Earth are very small; in terms of the star’s lifetime, a few thousand years is the blink of an eye. A star would have to be very, very near its own death for this to happen after a very, very long life.

I can think of very few exceptions, though Eta Carinae fits the bill. It’s on the edge of exploding; in the 1840s it underwent a massive paroxysm that was just short of a supernova event. It may not go off for another 50,000 years, but it might tonight.

8481,[],,PhotonSorcerer,,,[],,,,text,t2_44shrqya,False,False,[],"I humbly present my second image of a deep space object, Triangulum. Spiral galaxy M33 is located in the triangle-shaped constellation Triangulum, hence its name. About half the size of our Milky Way galaxy, M33 is the third-largest member of our Local Group of galaxies following the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way.

The Triangulum galaxy’s orderly spiral structure displays few signs of interactions with nearby galaxies. However, that could change in the future. Only slightly farther away from us than the Andromeda galaxy, about 3 million light-years from Earth, M33 is a suspected gravitational companion to Andromeda, and both galaxies are moving toward our own. M33 could become a third party involved in the impending collision between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies more than 4 billion years from now.

M33 has a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 5.7, making it one of the most distant objects that keen-eyed observers can view with the unaided eye (under exceptionally clear and dark skies). Although a telescope will start to reveal some of M33’s spiral features, the diffuse galaxy is actually easiest to examine with low magnification and a wide field of view, such as through binoculars. It is best observed in October.

Although others may have viewed the galaxy earlier, Charles Messier was the first to catalog M33 after observing it in August 1764. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble studied dozens of variable stars (those that periodically change brightness) in M33, which helped him to estimate the object’s distance and prove that M33 is not a nebula within our own galaxy, as previously suspected, but actually a separate galaxy outside our own.

Thanks to the inverse square law and the astronomical distances involved, a radio source from an intelligent species is going to fade into the background noise pretty quickly.

Couple that with the speed of light, and we have an even greater problem. Humans have been making radio transmissions for about a century, meaning our earliest transmissions are reaching, at most, 100 light years. If there's an alien species with their own SETI project, this means they'd have to be within 100 light years of us to even detect our transmission. By corollary, we'd have to be close enough to detect their signals in the span of time they've been making them.

If we're just looking for *any* intelligent signal, from any point in time, well, that just means a much greater likelihood that such a signal is a) getting swamped out by interfering sources of RF energy, or b) is so far away that the inverse square law works its magic. This is, of course, assuming an alien race would be using RF to communicate in the first place.

\- The black point is set too high and makes it look like a cutout. You should be able to see the transition into darkness near the terminator. A jet black sky also looks unnatural, there's no noise or grain or any indication that it's not a cutout on a black piece of paper. Pick an area outside the moon and it's near surroundings to set the black point as there's a bit of a light but almost imperceptible halo around it (due to diffraction.)

\- It looks like it was stretched pretty aggressively, so the noise has been amplified which means the finer detail is lost. Also the stretching has caused ringing (note how the edge of the moon almost looks inset or turned.)

Generally speaking, a more natural look tends to be better unless you're going for artistic appeal. Getting it non-full was good and it's even better when it's 1/4 or 3/4 phase (half on the left, or half on the right.) Figure out when the Lunar X will be visible and aim to image that.

A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.  (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity.)Although Einstein made unpublished calculations on the subject in 1912, Orest Khvolson (1924) and Frantisek Link (1936) are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print. However, this effect is more commonly associated with Einstein, who published an article on the subject in 1936.Fritz Zwicky posited in 1937 that the effect could allow galaxy clusters to act as gravitational lenses.

Some months ago I visited Nueva Helvecia in Uruguay to photograph this old mill constructed in 1876. Just five years later it burned down and there are lot of stories trying to explain why this happened. This place gave me chills at night and luckily I wasn’t alone.

On the left the Magellanic Clouds are visible and on the right the center of the Milky Way.

The optics are fine, but the mount is just not fun to use.

Pretty much everyone will recommend a 6 or 8 inch dobsonian telescope for beginners. The reason for this is because you get the most aperture for your money, and because of the simple design they are VERY easy to use and extremely stable.

Aperture is what will determine how much magnification you can use, and how much light your scope collects.

The Sky-Watcher 8"" dob is about $379 USD right now, and it's an infinitely better value for your money than the Celestron 130.

This is a great reflection nebulae known as NGC 6726. Reflection nebulae are floating clouds of microscopic dust that end up scattering nearby starlight through a process known as Rayleigh Scattering. This is actually the same process that goes on in our atmosphere causing it to be blue, which in turn is the reason this nebulae is a sky blue color! The compounds that make up the dust component are carbon compounds (a mixture of graphite and diamonds) along with some other elements like iron and nickel. 

This particular nebula is another one of the many targets mainly visible from the southern hemisphere. One of the many targets I have been able to take advantage of with the opening of our new observatory located in the Atacama Desert of Chile. While this setup is still in the preliminary stages of testing, [we do have other setups available for public use, or free data sets you can download.](https://deepskywest.com/)

The answer is because of their luminosity (or brightness). In astronomy, we use the term ""apparent magnitude"" to scale the luminosity of objects in the sky when seen from Earth. The most faint objects a person can see with the naked eye is about 6-7 on the scale, so for example Uranus is barely visible (under dark skies and seeing conditions). You can read about it here:

[This video shows the process used to capture and develop the images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CVxcPoM8Xg). 

Text version:

I attach my camera to my telescope with a T-ring adaptor, and 2X Barlow lens (required for this particular telescope to reach focus properly).

I record a 1080p video and use 3X digital zoom to increase the size of the object. 

I set the object into the middle of the frame and let it drift by (my telescope has no tracking). 

I take the video files and run them through a program called [PiPP](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/) to stabilize the frames and convert the video file to a more suitable format for stacking. 


I take the video files and stack the frames with [AutoStakkert](https://www.autostakkert.com/).

I take the output file and bring out more details with a program called [Registax](https://www.astronomie.be/registax/).

I do this 20-30 times to create enough frames to make a timelapse. 

I used photoshop to manually align the frames and output a video file from there.

Not everything in space is small, many objects are actually much bigger than the Moon. People largely overestimate the size of our Moon, [when in reality it is only only *half a degree in width, or a tic-tac held at arms length.*](https://youtu.be/qMALXeeTZlA?t=366) Compare this to the LMC, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, which is 20 times wider than the full Moon.

This graphic was created by calculating the amount of angular width each pixel represents in the sky, for the main image. This value came out to be 29.3 arcseconds / pixel, or in other terms, every pixel only represents 1/120th of a degree.

**Location Details**

* **Location:** Canberra, Australia
* **Light Pollution:** Bortle 6
* **Moon Phase:** 61% Waxing Gibbous
* **Weather:** Slight cloud cover.

**Acquisition Details**

* **Camera:** Canon EOS 70D
* **Lens:** Canon 24-105mm lens @ 105mm f/4
* **Exposures:** 31x 3"" lights, 5x 3"" darks (ISO 3200)
* **Tripod**: Optex OPM1780G

**Software Details**

* **Stacking:** Stacked in DeepSkyStacker using 90% of frames (27 in total) with Kappa Sigma Clipping.
* **Post Processing:** Mostly done in photoshop. Stretched the histogram, set the black point with colour sampling (is that the correct terminology), and used curves to pull out extra detail. Then opened in [Paint.NET](https://paint.net/) and used noise reduction (played around with settings until I was happy).

&gt; &amp;quot;Trying to understand the evolution of the neutral hydrogen that pervaded the early universe is really the last unexplored space on our cosmic map,&amp;quot; says Chris Carilli, chief scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and a contributor to the HERA project.

&gt; PAPER was just the first step on the road to an even larger telescope array designed to detect the low frequency emissions of neutral hydrogen from the early universe: HERA. With nearly three times as many antennas as PAPER, HERA stands to be one of the most sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes ever built.

&gt; Ultimately, the HERA team hopes to create a &amp;quot;Movie&amp;quot; of the large-scale evolution of the universe that occurred directly before and after the first stars were formed.

\- Join a local amateur astronomy club. This is the fastest way you'll learn about the sky and the one you'll enjoy the most. You'll meet a lot of experienced people who share your passion and lov to share their knowledge, specially with people who are just starting in the hobby. They'll probably have star parties and teach courses on different related subjects.

\- Download Stellarium and start playing with it. Play with the time controls. What happens as the hours go by? What happens if you look at the same place of the sky at the same hour as the days go by? That way you'll start to get a grasp about the movements of the sky. Go out and try to identify the objects you see and that grab your attention by whatever reason (because they're bright, or their location or disposition, etc.). Start with one constellation. Right now you have Scorpius up in the sky, with Antares being a very identifiable star. Sagittarius is by the side. Those are summer constellations (for the northern hemisphere). Jupiter and Saturn are there too right now. If you stay up late enough, you'll see Orion rising to the East, a very identifiable winter constellation. Find Rigel (the blue bright star in it) and Betelgeuse (the bright red star). You'll find Aldebaran (another bright red star) from Taurus at one side, and the Pleyades if you keep going in that direction. From Orion to the other side you'll see another very bright blue star, that's Sirius, from Canis Major. One you're familiar with those, you star identifying other bright objects nearby.

\- Read some books on the subject. When I was starting I read ""Stargazing for dummies"" and ""Astronomy for dummies"" and I found them very helpful. I've seen ""Turn left at Orion"" recommended a lot here, so I'm guessing it's a classic, but I never read it. Surely there's a lot more.

*****
&gt; Making monster galaxies When two spiral galaxies - like our Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy - collide, they can merge and form an elliptical galaxy.

&gt; Their central black holes combine as well and make larger black holes, which can kick huge swaths of nearby stars out to the edges of the newly formed galaxy.

&gt; The resulting extra-large elliptical galaxy usually doesn&amp;#039;t have much gas from which to form new stars, so its center looks pretty bare after its black hole kicks out nearby stars.

Deep space objects in the other hand are so dim that you can’t even see a lot of them with the naked eye. You would have to keep the shutter of the camera open for minutes at a time to capture the light being emitted from the object.

Humans were not designed to view space objects. Most nebulae emit light at the hydrogen alpha line, 656 nm. Your eyes have a very hard time detecting this light since it's almost infrared, so even if you were to go on a spaceship and fly to the helix nebula it would be black and white, or maybe red if you're lucky.

Also, most things in space are extremely faint. For example, the edges of the Andromeda Galaxy only emit a few *photons* per second onto each camera pixel. That is why people do 10, 20, 40 hour exposures.

The ""raw"" images that come from the camera look very similar to the final image. The only difference is that you apply changes to make it more appealing such as colour saturation, or HDR.

I think you need to understand how telescopes work. You can think of one as a large bucket which collects rain - in terms of a telescope, the bucket is the primary mirror or lens, and the rain is photons emitted or reflected by whatever your viewing. By having a larger telescope, you’ll basically collect more light, meaning that the view will be brighter. But as you magnify, the view gets dimmer. The brightness of an image is determined by the exit pupil.

Exit pupil (diameter of the light beam exiting the eyepiece) is determined by the focal length of your eyepiece divided the focal ratio of your scope. So a f/5 scope with a 10mm eyepiece will deliver a 2mm exit pupil, and a 2.5mm eyepiece will deliver a 0.5mm exit pupil (which is already pretty dim). The smaller the exit pupil, the dimmer the image is because your pupil collects very little light.

&gt;In the Mössbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. **When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.**

However while you can do it provided you correct for the rotation curve of the galaxy you're in, I don't think its ideal. For example, the Milky Way's cosmic year is roughly 200 million Earth years. This is too large to use. We need to keep our timekeeping as simple and as relevant as possible. 

Here's how I thought about it. 

  
We start simple. 

Earth takes 23 hrs 56mins 4s to rotate about it's axis. Here it is conveniently decided that Earth days are to be divided into 24 hours. Time is synchronized using the prime meridian in Greenwich England and time zones which adds or subtracts hours depending on how far you are from the prime meridian. 

Mars  takes 24hrs 39mins 35s to rotate about its axis. There have been proposed time keeping schemes for Mars. The question now is how do you synchronize Earth and Mars time? Simple, carry a clock (again, corrected for time dilation) that tells the time on Earth. 

Let's use a different planet for a clearer example. Suppose we get the technology to explore and settle on Venus. Venus takes 116 days 18 hrs to complete a rotation about its axis. How do you keep time? Let's keep things simple and just ignore the 18hrs(lol). One way is to devise ""Venus hours"" which lasts for 1 day and say 001:00 venus hour is equal to 001 Earth day 00 Earth hours. And thus it goes a Venus day starts at 000:00 and 001:00 is simply 000:24. This system is exclusively relevant to Venus. Meaning if you're on Earth, you wouldn't care about it unless you have business on Venus. They will be independent of each other. Now to synchronize the clocks we simply bring a clock on a rocket and fly to Venus. Once we get there we adjust the clock to compensate for time dilation and match its equivalent on Earth. If the clock leaves on a rocket at Greenwich England (for simplicity) and arrives on Venus. You can use it to find out the time on different time zones on Earth. We can do this because while our time systems may be arbitrary as in we set 1 minute = 60s 1 hr = 60 mins, 1 Venus hour = 1 Earth day = 86400s and so on, as long as the base units used is seconds, because 1 second is still the same time as 1 second in another part of the galaxy...provided you compensate for time dilation either due to velocity relative to an observer or gravity.",,1575524575,{},f9p7wrv,False,t3_e62xxt,False,True,t1_f9oje69,/r/Astronomy/comments/e62xxt/question_what_would_solar_time_be_called_how/f9p7wrv/,1575524576,1,True,False,Astronomy,t5_2qhor,0,,,[],

I returned to Jose Ignacio (Uruguay) after receiving the APOD on the lighthouse picture from this place. This is one of my favorite locations to enjoy stars and the view with the ocean. At this time of the year the galactic core is not visible so I wanted to focus on this part of the Milky Way. The Gum, Carina and Lambda Centauri nebulas can be seen with the pink/red color and also the southern cross.

On the other hand... To what degree the rotation that we see is due to Jupiter's natural rotation and not to Earth's rotation? I know that Jupiter rotates crazy fast, but as the Earth rotates our point of view would change, which means we would look at Jupiter at a different angle every minute and therefore get a different image, wouldn't we?

Also, and this is some back-of-the-napkin calculation that could be awfully wrong, looking at the red spot it looks like it does about a third of a revolution in the period of the video, that OP has clocked at 2 hours. That roughly means a full revolution in 6 hours, while it is supposed to be about 10 hours. I know the precision of my calculations is very low, but still, the difference seems to be too big.

I kept my telescope pointed at Jupiter for 2 hours and 21 minutes and captured 174 frames. This animation was captured using an Alt-Az mount, so the Great Red Spot appears to rise from the southeast and then dips again once Jupiter passes through the meridian.

Check out my Instagram [@chucksastrophotography](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) for more of these kinds of captures.

This animation is running at 30 frames per second. It was captured in July, 2019 from my backyard.

For trying to get something in the scope? That's different. I finally worked out a process that I've had success with using a tablet, my eye, telrad and finder. 

First, get Sky Safari. I've used other sky maps on Android, free and paid, but none of them had this very important feature--dynamic magnitude adjustment. What I mean by this is I can set the FoV to what I see when I look up, then set the lowest magnitude I can see naked eye. That closely resembles what I see in the sky. Makes finding easier. Then, and this is the unique part, if I zoom in, more stars appear as if I were looking through the scope. Other apps, the magnitude limit didn't change when zooming. 

Next, I set up the equipment display on Sky Safari which shows the FoV for my gear. I find my first guide star with my Telrad and star hop until I can't. Then I zoom in Sky Safari to my finder FoV and use it to guide my hops. Finally, I switch to my eye piece.

Long answer: Prominences are pretty chill most of the time. Disappearing after days or sometimes months. A prominence can also erupt. That's when they're not chill. One of two scenarios can now happen, either, it peaces out from the sun and travels into space as a coronal mass ejection, or it doesn't and falls back to the sun. Flares are often (but not always) accompanied by coronal mass ejections. [The Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) shows what can happen when these get particularly large.

Now on to the aurora. To cause an aurora, the simplest way to explain it is when charged and/or ionising particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere. These particles become trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and travel down the magnetic field lines (ie, towards the magnetic north pole), where they can ionise the atmosphere which is in turn seen glowing.

So, in summary, a CME (from a flare or erupting prominence) can cause aurorae.

Disclaimer: I don't know much about flares and CMEs, but I do know about prominences. Also, if you want, I can come back to this later and add sources.

Solar minimum is the period of least solar activity in the 11 year solar cycle of the Sun. During this time, sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes, and often does not occur for days at a time.  The date of the minimum is described by a smoothed average over 12 months of sunspot activity, so identifying the date of the solar minimum usually can only happen 6 months after the minimum takes place. Solar minima is correlated with changes in climate.
