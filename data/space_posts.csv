For one, the amount of power needed to spin something that large that fast would end up being more expensive than the rocket. 

Secondly, rockets tend to be built to withstand massive forces, but not massive forces applied to a single side of the vehicle in a centrifuge. You'd have to essentially either fling a submarine into orbit or re-invent the rocket. 

Thirdly I'm fairly sure that if you throw something at exit-velocity whilst in-atmosphere you effectively expose it to full re-entry heating conditions instantaneously on the wrong end of the rocket. On top of that, the amount of drag created by the atmosphere would slow your vehicle down in seconds anyway unless you launched it at well above exit velocity.

A space gun, sometimes called a Verne gun because of its appearance in From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, is a method of launching an object into space using a large gun- or cannonlike structure. Space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non-rocket spacelaunch. It has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into Earth's orbit (although after-launch propulsion of the satellite would be necessary to achieve a stable orbit), and could also launch spacecraft beyond Earth's gravitational pull and into other parts of the Solar System by exceeding Earth's escape velocity of about 11.20 km/s (40,320 km/h; 25,050 mph). However, these speeds are too far into the hypersonic range for most practical propulsion systems and also would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by aerodynamic drag.

This assumes the company can make enough money to self-fund itself while remaining a private company so the investors can't steer the company into another direction.  
  
So far SpaceX only working with rockets. Building rockets capable of reaching Mars is hard, but not that hard (as the SpaceX almost there). Building rockets which are capable of reaching Mars, entering into orbit, LANDING, getting back into orbit, then coming back to Earth is a different, way, way, WAY harder thing. I really hope SpaceX can pull this off, but even if they can:  
They have zero experience in building long term habitats, which capable of keeping humans safely (and healthy!) alive. This feat alone likely harder than building the rocket itself which capable of transporting them.  
  
&gt; They’ll have the fundamentals and promising future plans to get investor money.  
  
Sadly, if this would be true, then SpaceX would already get enough money to pull this off. Right now investors seeing future in their LEO rockets, capable deploying satellites, and in the Starlink project. Both of these projects aimed a sector where the need was there for a long time, just the capability not. If someone capable self-funding engineers who can pull it off (like Musk did) then money will follow, because, while it is a risky investment, it is an investment capable bringing back your money, tenfold. Going to Mars would drain a huge amount of money (which for a private corporation means it gets destroyed, while for a state it pretty much comes back again as tax) and has zero MONETARY results. From the scientistic point of view, it would be a huge achievement, but sadly most of the investors don't care about it (or SpaceX would have enough funding...)  
  
&gt; Apple has $200+ billion cash at hand  
  
And last time when I checked they didn't plan to use any of it to make humanities life better (except some PR stuns), which sadly confirm the ""investors don't give a shit about humanity if it doesn't generate money for them"" line.  
  
I am personally all SpaceX (especially Starlink) fan, and what Musk and this company pulled off is simply amazing.

I agree that NASA is too bureaucratic, but I do not at all agree with your assessment of the employees. It all starts with the leadership, and in this case, NASA is directed explicitly by Congress. It is literally illegal for them to spend money in ways that are not approved by Congress and signed by the President. The stagnation you refer to is not the NASA researchers, who continue to make advances in astronomy, engineering, computation, meteorology, climatology and a whole multitude of other subjects, but it is instead that there is a political choke hold on every single one of their projects.

NASA returned to annual studies for the rest of the '90s until they were killed by Bush the Dumber.  Then, in an election year, they spent an entire day grandiosely proposing a return to Mars, which was airily referred to for four more years.  No money was allocated and the ""plans"" were dusted-off pamphlets from the '90s.

The Mars Climate Orbiter (formerly the Mars Surveyor '98 Orbiter) was a 638-kilogram (1,407 lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998 to study the Martian climate, Martian atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars Surveyor '98 program for Mars Polar Lander. However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-force seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought it too close to the planet, and it was either destroyed in the atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars' atmosphere.

Intelsat 708 was a telecommunications satellite built by the American company Space Systems/Loral for Intelsat.  It was destroyed on 15 February 1996 when the Long March 3B rocket failed while being launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China.  The rocket veered off course immediately after liftoff and struck a nearby village, killing at least six people.The accident investigation identified a failure in the guidance system of the Long March 3B.  After the Intelsat 708 accident, the Long March rockets greatly increased in reliability and did not experience another mission failure until 2011.  However, the participation of American companies in the Intelsat 708 and Apstar 2 investigations caused great political controversy in the United States.

No. There have been no sightings of it since August 17, 1980. Even the 2009 paper that wikipedia cites mostly covers the massive uncertianties in if the thing is still in orbit or not (basicaly it depends where the spacecraft was in its orbit when solar activity increased the size of the atmosphere)

The same is true for the viking 2 orbiter although there is a very faint possibility that the spirt rover managed to image it:

I believe the size of Viking-1 was no more than 10 m.

Speaking of wavelength and resolution, to be sure we need to determine object's orbit too. Let's estimate what accuracy we would need. Assume best-case scenario: Mars at closest approach(about 0.5 a.u., which is about 75 million km), Viking's orbital radius is 4000 km (Mars radius about 3400 km + generous orbital height of 600 km), needed accuracy is 10% of orbital radius. Plugging all these numbers makes required resolution about 5*10^-6 radian or 3*10^-4 degrees = 1 arcsecond. This resolution is pretty challenging for existing equipment, as e.g. Arecibo Telescope can resolve only 10^-4 radian.

This is a test tank meant for the upper stage of SpaceX's new rocket, Starship/SuperHeavy (Previously BFR) which is meant to rapidly increase access to space and reach the Moon and Mars. Before anyone asks, it's most likely that they intended to test the tank until failure. 

[Elon tweeted that they were pressure testing the tank with cryogenic liquid nitrogen](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1222366667579117568) and went on to say that it reached 8.5 bar before blowing up. Overall sounds like a pretty good success.

The tank is a steel sphere about 30ft in diameter. It's a *production* prototype of Starship SN1's tanks. The middle part is integrated with the steel panels that will be visible on the outside of Starship and looked pretty shiney. They started building new big tents to do welding inside of and it seems they've had better success lately as a result. The steel rings they've been pumping out also look pretty incredible vs what we saw on the MK1 prototype. It's really looking like Starship is about to come together relatively quick.

[Labpadre's stream had a good view of it too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d8l_0w2VKM), but idk how to quickly post a segment of a live-stream. The time mark is about 9:48pm.

Ariane 5 is a European heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family, an expendable launch system designed by the French government space agency Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES). It is used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). 

German and French government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane. Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales.

An interstellar probe is a space probe that has left—or is expected to leave—the Solar System and enter interstellar space, which is typically defined as the region beyond the heliopause. It also refers to probes capable of reaching other star systems.

There are five interstellar probes, all launched by the American space agency NASA: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and New Horizons. As of 2019, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only probes to have actually reached interstellar space.

Those are robotic spacecraft, and won’t reach another star for thousands of years. You probably mean crewed interstellar travel, preferably within a human lifetime. Assuming the longest trip you could convince someone to take was 10 years, you’d have to be going about 40-50% of the speed of light to make it to the nearest stars. That’s a lot of energy. I wouldn’t rule it out, but barring the discovery of a loophole that allows FTL travel, we’re unlikely to live to see it. 

2) Probably not. Earth in Interstellar was undergoing a global crop blight that was slowly wiping out plant life, meaning humans needed to relocate food production somewhere where an effective quarantine could be enforced.

Hell, maybe fur trees will evolve in 500,000 years to build spaceships, eh?  Maybe I need to be a dendrologist in order to completely rule this out!

You STILL wont answer why this has never happened before us, either.  Cuz it's obviously super inconvenient to your argument.

&gt;Also your adamant stance on life having to be like us to be like humans to produce science and advanced society seems close minded to me and lacking in imagination.

I didn't suggest it'd have to resemble us specifically.  That's your convenient misinterpretation of my comments to help your own argument.

But yes, I am talking about a species that would be as intelligent and technologically advanced as us.  This isn't close-minded, this would require an inherent lineage of supremely advanced mental and physical capabilities.

&gt;Maybe the norm from multicellular life to spaceflight is 500m years or 6 billion... Until we meet a bunch of different extraterrestrials and study their past we cannot know.

Maybe there is no 'norm' at all as the set of circumstances involved are so insanely rare that trying to ascribe some 'timer' to things is beyond absurd.

&gt;It took 300.000 years from the first humans til spaceflight but for the first 290.000 of them we were as advanced as beavers.

Complete bullshit.  You seem to have a *super* poor understanding of anthropology.  Proto-humans were already quite advanced in most cases, and the brain size growth existed fairly directly with our direct ancestry.  But even THAT wasn't enough, as other large brained proto-humans like neanderthals didn't make it, yet homo sapiens did.

And you, as usual, ignore the big points, like the one about beavers and apes existing at all already accounting for like 90% of the apparent miracle of advanced life to begin with.  You're ignoring all the crazy amounts of things that had to go so right in those billions of years to get to that point to begin with, and you're basically only arguing for that last 10%.

A big improvement came from the Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990's. Before that, observations were just not accurate enough to detect the effects of solar wind and solar mass loss. To a large extent, they *still* aren't accurate enough.

So that leaves us with best-fit ephemerides using optical and a few radar observations; most of the good data comes from the mid-1960's and later. We can backwards compute these with standard gravity theories (i.e., General Relativity).

If there has been any change in the orbital distance Earth-Sun, it comes from the influence of Jupiter, Venus, and the other planets. It should be easy (!) to query the JPL HORIZONS system, to see if the average distance for 1920 is different from 2020, and if there has been any systematic change over the past 100 years.

... but it's time for me to fix dinner ... (back from dinner)

I checked with HORIZONS, and basically the orbit size changes by +/- 2 km on a roughly 12 to 16 year cycle. I had to do a lot of averaging to get that number, because the *instantaneous* (osculating) orbit changes by a lot more than that. There is a small trend upward, of less than 1 km per century, but it's just an artifact of the particular time period used. If I had picked the 16th century (for example), the trend might be in the other direction.

There's no reason that there *has* to be some 'apex' civilization-style species.

If homo sapiens went extinct overnight, there's no reason to think any other species would come along and replace us.  

&gt;Btw, why is the beaver analogy absurd? The are mammals, social creatures and have an aptitude for molding their enviroment. Give them another 500k years and who knows what will happen? Look how we changed in 10k

Because we weren't like beavers 500,000 years ago.  Hell, much of the proto-human ancestry tree is full of species that were basically far superior than apes today.  Just this advancement from ape to human alone is amazing and could have so easily gone wrong somewhere, as it actually did for tons of branches of this proto-human tree.

There is genuinely nothing about beavers, or basically any other species beyond our own direct ancestry tree, that would indicate any likelihood of becoming a species that could achieve similar accomplishments as humans have.

And lastly, you're ignoring that the existence of complex life like mammals at all isn't already like 90% of the 'improbability' of the existence of humans in the first place.

You're kidding, right?  You honestly think that humans are the reason that no other species has become far more intelligent?  This is a fucking ridiculous example.  Again, humans haven't been around that long.  Shit, we've only been 'studying brains' as natural historians for a couple hundred years.  

&gt;No humans version: that beaver now thrives with no rivals and able to pass it's intelligence gene on to offspring, stir the pot for half a million years and there is beaver hover dam and beaver playboy channel.

Ignoring the absolute absurdity of this argument, you still haven't explained why this has never happened in the time previous to humans being a technologically advanced species.  I feel like you're just being stubborn at this point.

&gt;End of the story is that there are too many unknowns to give you a number of civs that may be out there no matter how you tweak the formula in drake's equation but what we do know is that we live in an average sized galaxy in a average type starsystem not far and not close to anything special. Water and energy which makes up most of our makeup us abundant in the universe and that the universe is absolutely, massively, mind-boggling, ridiculously big and that seems to me like as good a reason as any to be reasonably certain that whatever kind of life is actually possible already exists and have for a lobg time and will continue to be created for the forseable future.

No, this isn't the 'end of story'.  This is your 'feelings' on things, not some reasoned analysis based on real information.

And there's a WHOLE LOT more that had to go right for humans to come into existence and become what we have other than having water and energy and being in an 'average galaxy'.  We also have plenty of reason to believe our own solar system is not actually average at all.  Far from it.  Not that this would be the only other factor, either way.

It looks to me with their jargon that they’re fairly certain it was a planetesimal. We obviously can’t see the core of our own planet so it’s hard to compare, but most scientists infer that rocky, terrestrial planets have metallic cores and that it is not all too common for asteroids to be made up of entirely exposed iron/nickel.

So to answer you: They think it’s a planet core because our understanding is as rocky planets form, denser metals are pushed to the center of the planet, and seeing as 16 Psyche is virtually entirely dense metal, that’s why they believe it to be a planet without a crust. 

The question on hand for them is that it does have an odd characteristic: It’s much less dense than it should be.

The names of the week make more sense when you look at the Anglo-Saxon names. They copied the tradition of naming the days of the week after gods from the Romans, who did the same. In most cases they took the Roman god the day was named after, and substituted it with their own god who was most similar to the Roman one. Since this happened in Roman times, the naming of the days of the week actually predates the breakup of the Proto-Germanic language into Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse, Old High German, Old Low Saxon, and all the rest. Here is each day in Anglo Saxon and Old Norse. I put the name of the god in parentheses after each day.

&gt;Northrop Grumman currently enjoys what’s known as a “cost-plus” contract with NASA. That means the contractor will be reimbursed by the government for everything that is required to build this telescope — from the personnel needed to build and test the spacecraft to the facilities and hardware that need to be created to piece everything together. It also means if you run over budget, the government will pick up the expenses.

&gt;Northrop Grumman is in charge of building and testing  Webb’s sun shield and spacecraft elements. For a project as complex and  pioneering as Webb, errors are to be expected. But the errors made under  Northrop Grumman’s watch were avoidable, according to independent  reviews. Workers used the wrong solvent to clean the observatory’s  propulsion valves. A wiring error severely damaged the spacecraft’s  pressure transducers. During an important test, the fasteners designed  to hold the sun shield together came loose, scattering dozens of bolts  that took months to find

We check when the probe recorded the star exploding and we see that it recorded the nova 1 year earlier than we saw it on earth.

Light takes time to travel, just as sound takes time to travel.

An optical spectrometer (spectrophotometer, spectrograph or spectroscope) is an instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials. The variable measured is most often the light's intensity but could also, for instance, be the polarization state. The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy, such as reciprocal centimeters or electron volts, which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength.

A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities.

He can't because the unlisted planets weren't visible to the ancient greeks and thus had no ancient greek names.

&amp;#x200B;

And notice if you go through this thread you'll see that every culture had their own names for the visible planets. But when it came to Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (not a planet anymore), the names in the non-english language are basically translations of the functions of those greco-roman god names. That's because no culture knew about Uranus, Neptune, and the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Also notice that no one seems to have a name for ""Earth"" that is like the planetary names, the planet we stand on is nearly always simply called 'dirt/land/earth/tellus/terra' etc. Thats because no ancient culture understood that Earth was a planet in the same way that Mars and Jupiter (which were just moving bright lights in the night sky) were planets.",,1580238212,{},ffub18n,False,t3_ev4thu,False,True,t3_ev4thu,/r/space/comments/ev4thu/fun_fact_in_greece_we_call_planets_the_names_of/ffub18n/,1580247444,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

Volcanology (also spelled vulcanology) is the study of volcanoes, lava, magma, and related geological, geophysical and geochemical phenomena (volcanism).   The term volcanology is derived from the Latin word vulcan.  Vulcan was the ancient Roman god of fire.

A volcanologist is a geologist who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes, and their current and historic eruptions.

So as much confused they can be in English , partly because some of the translations to latin of Chronos used the version of Khronos which made the confusion even worse. In  Greek both those names are never used for similar meanings. They neither sound the same or written the same way.

&gt;You can imagine the electrons interacting with the electric component of light, these interactions will induce their own waves which interfere with each other and the original wave to form a wave front which is (usually) trailing the original wave front.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is more accurate because photons being absorbed would not affect the direction of the photon that is then emitted, i.e if you shone a laser into a block of glass (or any material) you wouldn't get a beam out the other end, you would just get the light being scattered causing the whole block to light up.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other issue is that in some materials, the phase or group velocities of light actually exceed C, this definitely can not be explained by photons being absorbed and then reemitted as it would need to take negative time.

What happens in the sun is as you describe, but it isn't the same as in transparent materials. The sun is opaque to light which is how it gets absorbed and reemitted in a random walk, causing extreme scatting. The reason it takes so long is because the direction is completely random, so it takes a very long time for energy associated with a photon to randomly reach the edge of the opaque region.",,1580233028,{},ffu2ese,False,t3_euvidq,False,True,t1_fft2zcv,/r/space/comments/euvidq/betelgeuse_is_continuing_to_dim_its_down_to_1506/ffu2ese/,1580237734,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

Other times Kronos was the same deity as Kronos God of time, other times no. 

Other times Tartaros was a deity portrayed by a place, and other times it was just a place.

And the list goes on and on up until at least the Olympian Era where mythology is pretty much the same.

Zeus also was portrayed as the Father because he was the one ruling the land. As did Poseidon rule the sea and Hades the underworld.

On the very top we have many diffirent candidates. We have Chaos as a mentions, Nyx the night itself , Chronos time itself , not to be confused with Kronos the leader of titans. In other stories we have elements, like fire , water and air. In another scenario which also very popular we have the element of Logos, which in ancient and modern greek translates to speech, writting and logic. So general Ancient greeks believed not in characters as the top but rather concepts and fundamental ideas.

While Gods are characters themselves. For example Zeus is often refered by hollywood and modern foreign writers as the sky god, which of course is not the case, Zeus was just a god, lighting was just a weapon that Cyclops or Hephaestus made for him. On the other hand Uranus was the actual sky. So it actually a lot more complicated than you think.

&amp;#x200B;

So the diffirence between Chaos and Zeus or any other gods was massive, also on the practical side too, Chaos had no temples and no worshipers , or Uranus or Gaia. Gods did. Hesiods does not present them as characters but rather philosophical notions.

Even full-blown Kessler syndrome doesn't result in an ""impenetrable shell"", you can pass through such orbital zones with little risk of collision and what risk there is can be mitigated with a bit of armor. It's a significant risk only for things that want to stay orbiting *within* such zones for long periods of time.

The density of orbital debris is higher in lower orbits, but the lifespan of orbital debris is much lower in lower orbits. Small fragments experience more atmospheric drag and perturbations due to solar pressure, so they deorbit sooner. So low Earth orbit would only be hazardous for a few years or decades after a full-blown Kessler cascade, and that's the altitude where Kessler syndrome is most likely to occur in the first place.

Debris can be cleaned. There are various approaches under development, and I'm sure that development would speed up if important orbital regions actually became hazardous.

And finally, our planet isn't ""dying"". And even if it were, there are no other planets to ""escape"" to that would be remotely as hospitable as even the worst-case scenario post-apocalyptic Earth.

i never figured out the order of the weekdays in Japanese. now I know it's based on the planets it is easier to remember that. thanks!",,1580225383,{},ffto3a8,False,t3_ev4thu,False,True,t1_fftm3rt,/r/space/comments/ev4thu/fun_fact_in_greece_we_call_planets_the_names_of/ffto3a8/,1580225385,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

If you look at [this plot](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/plot/Inner2.gif) of the inner solar system, the circles are the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.  The red dots are ""Near Earth Asteroids"", defined as coming less than 1.3 times the Earth's distance from the Sun.  There are over 21,000 found so far, and some of them are ""metallic"".

The metallics are typically 90% iron, 9% nickel, and 1% cobalt.  Other asteroids have carbon compounds.  If you add some carbon to an iron alloy, you get a steel alloy.

Steel wouldn't be the most efficient material for a habitat.  A fiber-reinforced lighter metal like aluminum or titanium would weigh less.  But steel is used for all kinds of other industrial things.

Eventually 98-99% of space projects could be made from materials already in space.  That avoids most of the launch cost from Earth.  The other 1-2% are rare materials not easily found in space, and hard-to-make items like computer chips and plant seeds, where its just easier to send them from Earth.",,1580224733,{},fftn425,False,t3_euwsqy,False,True,t1_ffs5e58,/r/space/comments/euwsqy/nasa_is_sending_a_spacecraft_to_16_psyche_a_giant/fftn425/,1580224742,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

The top of the food chain is Chaos himslef or should we say itself according to Hesiods the father of ancient Greek mythology and religion, second to none including Homer himself. 

Other divine entities far superior in power compared to gods are the well known Cyclops and the Ecatocheires. Both practical unbeatable, the first in knowledge (the essence of science, knowledge and technology) and latter in physical power (their name translates in Greek as the ones with the one hundrerd hands)

Even monsters were superior in power to gods, the example being Typhon, the ""god killer"" a beast Gaia unleasted when Titans were defeated. Although that its inacurate Gods will never have won the war if they have not enlisted the help of not only Titans but also the heavyweight of Cyclops and Ecatocheires.

Well... you might not be too familiar with the way technological growth curves work (I'm guessing you've never read any books by Ray Kurzweil, for example?) but really it's more like just a few decades from now that we'll have the expertise to do such a thing if we really wanted to! 

So ya, no need to wait for 100 to 200 million years of technological evolution to pull off such a basic simple task such as adding mass to a planet. (With 100 to 200 million years of additional technological years of evolution, we'll hopefully be long gone, moving on to far more profound things like perhaps even creating new universes! )

------------------------

But ya... anyways, the answer to this question is that it is simply not something you need to worry about. 

Even if we bring home HUGE and massive amounts of precious metals from asteroids, it will not make any significant difference to Earth's overall gravitational distribution. 

So of all the things that could go wrong in the future, for you to worry about... this you can be certain is at the absolute bottom of the list.

But hey: if this concern is still keeping you up at night worrying, then just know this: 

With 100 to 200 million years of technological evolution, at that point you'll simply be able to snap your fingers like magic in that far future, and have a massive fleet of robotic anti-gravity machines instantly obey your command, and lighten the load that planet Earth is carrying, by flinging unneeded material off Earth!",,1580216653,{},fftcrww,False,t3_ev3r1s,False,True,t3_ev3r1s,/r/space/comments/ev3r1s/is_it_possible_to_increase_earth_mass_and_what/fftcrww/,1580216654,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

&gt; we have somehow observed the universe expanding and came to the conclusion that it must have at one point been MUCH smaller.

This is kinda obvious if you think about it, but the big bang happened everywhere at the same time. To give the universe a size is problematic because it leads you to believe that at the beginning there was an explosion that sent stuff in all directions, an explosion into 'empty space'. In fact, when we say universe, it IS space, it IS time. So at a certain instant in time (we don't know whether this is the first instant, or if there is a cycle, or if time has always existed and the big bang was some random perturbation in the quantum foam), space started expanding everywhere. Thus, the big bang happened everywhere.

Talking about density is closer to the truth. Near the beginning, everything was dense and hot because most particles were squeezed up against each other side-by-side. Since more available space is being constantly produced by cosmological expansion and because for complex physics reasons matter does not like being in this compressed state, matter starts diffusing and the universe begins to cool down. At this point it would be the end of the story if not for the weak and frankly forgettable force called gravity. Billions of years later, instead of a eternal, uniform and lifeless fog of dimming hydrogen (well, mostly), we have all kinds of cool macro structures like galaxies and stars.

The universe would be a vastly different place without gravity, is what I'm saying.

&gt; I also know that scientific consensus seems to indicate that the entire universe was once the size of an atom

The consensus is that the universe was once super-hot and super-dense. For most people, it suffices to say the universe was once super tiny, but as explained above, if a person carefully thinks about it, it really is a nonsensical idea to try to assign size to the entire universe*. The key thing to remember is that careless handling of facts will lead you astray.

* Assigning size to our *observable* universe is much easier and well-defined. It is about 93 billion light years across.

&gt; Moreover how did they decide it was ever a singularity at all? Why do we not assume it is expanding and collapsing over and over infinitely in both directions taking billions or even trillions of years between beats?

The Big Bang theory is an explanation of how our current universe came to be, it is not trying to explain how it began. Here is a perfectly compatible origin theory: God waved his hand, and there was a Big Bang. Replace God with cycles, branes, multiverses, etc.

&gt; I also know people talk about cosmic microwave background radiation, but I have no idea what that is. They keep showing the crazy looking heat map with mostly blue and green blotches with some yellow and red specs randomly thrown about. I don't really understand what this map shows or how it proves the big bang.

The CMBR is the earliest possible snapshot of the distribution of matter and energy in the universe. Before that time the universe was too dense and hot for light to travel very far. So all you would see (if you could) would be a glowing, uniform fog when in fact the universe was already becoming a very interesting place. As soon as the universe cooled down enough that light could travel in straight lines for a long distance, you can begin to see these structures. The CMBR is very strong evidence of the big bang because we can measure its temperature and compare it with cosmological redshift (a prediction of the big bang). It matches near perfectly.

So the sequence of events we think happened:
??? (the beginning?) &gt; BANG &gt; expansion ---&gt; after a long time, cools enough that light can travel ----------&gt; we see this ancient light, and work backwards. The distance this light has traveled and it's temperature coincides exactly as if the BANG and expansion happened.

Finally:

&gt; From everything I understand about the way things work, all events have to be triggered by something.

This probably isn't true. For example, what causes the decay of U-235 into Th-231 ? Beats me. At ground level, the universe may be many, many events happening completely at random.

Superluminal communication is a hypothetical process in which information is sent at faster-than-light (FTL) speeds. The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment.

Superluminal communication is impossible because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to transmit information into the past. This contradicts causality and leads to logical paradoxes.A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including tachyons, quantum nonlocality, and wormholes.

The largest powers have also conducted tests and experiments, of varying subtlety, on how space may have some military potential.

As an example, during the Cold War the USSR could not make sense of the US Space Shuttle. It simply did not make sense, from a cost-benefit perspective, to use this costly and complicated platform for the stated purposes of research and space activities which up to then (and continuing in the USSR) had been done adequately with Apollo-era technology. So they built their own version, the Buran, and flew it about a bit, and quickly confirmed their suspicion that the Shuttle was really built to deliver and service spy satellites. When the Cold War ended, congressional support for the Shuttle fell off sharply, and the programme ended in 2011, with no backup plan for delivery of personnel to orbit, since that was never its main purpose.

More recently, Boeing has been testing an unmanned long-duration spaceplane for the military. And no doubt there are similar programmes going on, at various stages. None of this is even slightly new.

I think that would be the tricky part, not just memory transfer but consciousness transfer, having hundreds of bodies isn't useful if they only share old memories while creating new unique memories of their own.

3645,[],,technocraticTemplar,,,[],,,,text,t2_bbgcn,False,False,[],"[This page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Solar_system) has the answers to a lot of questions about the abundances of various things, along with [this paper](https://web.archive.org/web/20060901133923/http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf) for a more in depth technical explanation.  

The simple answer seems to be that it's just not actually all that special.  Although nickel is relatively common, it's still 4 or 5 times less abundant than iron, which itself is much less common than oxygen, carbon, and silicon (and way way behind hydrogen and helium).  It's with iron so often just because they're both heavy metals that tend to sink to the cores of forming planets.

The more technical answer is that it's the next stable element up after iron in stellar/supernova nucleosynthesis.  [This chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#/media/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg) illustrates where the various elements have mostly come from in the universe so far.  One thing you'll notice is that things don't change drastically at iron.  Although iron is the last element that can be created while releasing energy in normal fusion, there are other processes that can continue to add to the atom past that.  The [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process) and s-process are two ways that free neutrons in a star will transmute iron up into heavier elements.  The r-process (for rapid) happens in violent events like supernovas and neutron star mergers, while the s-process (for slow) happens gradually as smaller stars like our own age.  Thanks to things like this a noteworthy amount of iron ends up being turned into all the higher elements in the periodic table before or during a star's death.",,1580185286,{},ffsm9z5,False,t3_euwsqy,False,True,t1_ffs964r,/r/space/comments/euwsqy/nasa_is_sending_a_spacecraft_to_16_psyche_a_giant/ffsm9z5/,1580185287,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

The asteroid belt is the ""leftovers"" from the formation of the solar system, that couldn't form into a single large body because of Jupiter pulling the individual rocks around.

If 16-Psyche is the remnant of a larger body the rest of that body is no longer in the asteroid belt, because its composition doesn't match the rest of the asteroids in the belt.  What likely happened (if that is how it formed) is the rest of it merged with whatever impacted it to form a new planet or planetoid, which was then ejected from the solar system.

All the material that eventually formed our solar system is essentially recycled star dust. All iron on Earth (and in 16 Psyche) was produced by large stars that existed before our Sun formed: the iron was created during nuclear fusion and later released when the parent star(s) exploded, presumably supernova. 

After our solar nebula had formed and material had been gravitationally compacted, dense elements like iron did not get far from the center of the nebula before ""precipitating"" out into planets and meteors. Thus the inner solar system has a high abundance of iron. This is in contrast to low-density elements/molecules that were in general able to escape the center of the nebula and make it pretty far before being pulled into a large mass.

The shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy.

Cosmologists distinguish between the observable universe and the global universe.

&gt;From what I do know about the big bang, the reason we even know about it is because we have somehow observed the universe expanding and came to the conclusion that it must have at one point been MUCH smaller. I also know people talk about cosmic microwave background radiation, but I have no idea what that is. They keep showing the crazy looking heat map with mostly blue and green blotches with some yellow and red specs randomly thrown about. I don't really understand what this map shows or how it proves the big bang. 

When the big bang theory came along there was another theory called the steady state theory. Steady-state theory is a view that the universe is always expanding but maintaining a constant average density, with matter being continuously created to form new stars and galaxies at the same rate that old ones become unobservable as a consequence of their increasing distance and velocity of recession.

The cosmic background radiation is often called the smoking gun, because it is the evidence that the big bang theory needed which let it prevail over steady state. It is the residual effects of the big bang. The redshift of distant galaxy is another proof, but it wasn't enough to discount steady state.



&gt;Moreover how did they decide it was ever a singularity at all? Why do we not assume it is expanding and collapsing over and over infinitely in both directions taking billions or even trillions of years between beats? 

We actually do not have proof of the initial singularity yet, but because we have the cosmic background radiation and etc we do know that the big bang happened even if we do not know for certain about the singularity. We do know that if you reverse the expansion enough that spacetime would becomes infinitely dense.

As for expanding/collapsing that is a theory for the end of the universe it is called the big bounce. The reason why it is not the prevailing theory is because we are now observing that the universe is expanding exponentially because of dark energy. We don't know what dark energy is but as long as the universe continues to expand like this the leading deaths for the universe are the big freeze/heat death/big rip. We will never know if the expansion universe eventually slows and reverses but right now we are not observing that.


&gt;Also, they seemed to have settled on the big bang having started about 14 billion years ago, but why are they assuming that there ever was a beginning to it. Why are they not assuming it has always been getting larger at an exponential rate? Then going back in time, the universe would just be getting smaller and smaller and time would be slowing down more and more always getting closer to zero, but never reaching it. Why are we not assuming the universe is infinite with no beginning? 

Since the universe was so dense time and space didn't exist the way we know it. So we cannot assume that there was a before the universe because before can't exist before time exists. 

However we do believe the universe is infinite because if you were able to get to the edge of the observable universe and looked past what we can observe on earth we assume that all you would see is more universe! You could keep going to the edges of the observable universe and continue to see more universe. Since time and space is one thing and space is infinitely large then time is also infinite. 

&gt;From everything I understand about the way things work, all events have to be triggered by something. If the universe isn't infinite and it did get started, then what was the triggering event that started it? How would it even cause the trigger to fire if there was no universe for the triggering event to happen and no amount of time for it to even happen in? People always say, ""humans are incapable of wrapping their minds around infinity."" For me, infinity is really easy to understand, finite time and finite space is the one that I have trouble with; especially something happening outside of the finite time and space. 

There doesn't need to be a reason that the expansion started. If it never happened it wouldn't have mattered because there wouldn't be anything around for it to matter to. It is only because it happen that it matters. It seems significant to us because it is significant to us, but if it didn't happen no one would be around for it to matter. I don't believe there needs to be a trigger for the beginning of the universe to be significant, it's significant because now the universe exists. Sorry if that's more philosophical, but the question seemed more philosophical.",,1580165117,{},ffrsxl1,False,t3_euuil8,False,True,t3_euuil8,/r/space/comments/euuil8/im_trying_to_understand_the_big_bang_event_better/ffrsxl1/,1580165118,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

This was originally emitted when the average temperature of the universe was around 3000 K and the light has been redshifted to a temperature around 3 K from the expansion. The images you're used to seeing show the temperature variations of the CMB, where blue a colder than average and red is hotter. Note that the deviations from the average are very, very small. 

The small deviations are evidence that the early universe was homogeneous. That they're incredibly small points to the universe expanding very rapidly in the beginning (look up cosmic inflation).

We have good observational evidence for the age of the universe.

If you hold your thumb out in front of you and close one eye, then swap to the other, you'll see your thumb move relative to the wall/background. This apparent movement depends on the distance between your eyes and from your eyes to your thumb.  


We can do the same by measuring stars relative to distant background stars/objects and by using the distance between one side of the earth's orbit and the other as the distance between our eyes. If the angle between these two measurements is equal to one arcsecond (1/3600th of a degree) then the distance to the star is 1 parsec (Like parralax-arcsecond) which is about 3.3 light years.

Why is this at all a political decision?  Whether or not the moon is a good way to get to Mars is an engineering question that a couple of politicians have no business answering.

“The detailed engineering activities conducted under the Experimental Spaceplane Program affirmed that no technical showstoppers stand in the way of achieving DARPA’s objectives, and that a system such as XSP would bolster national security,” Adams said. “Through XSP, DARPA identified evidence that present-day liquid rocket propulsion systems are capable of supporting XSP objectives, remain of interest, and may be explored in separate efforts.”

“We will make it a priority to harvest the significant learnings from this effort and apply them as Boeing continues to seek ways to provide future responsive, reusable access to space,” Drelling said.

4430,[],,Colonize_The_Moon,,,[],,,,text,t2_icfus,False,False,[],"What is 'militarization' when it comes to space?  

Rockets were used by the Germans to terrorize the UK, particularly London.  Operation Paperclip snaffled up about 1600 German scientists, including Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team.  Those scientists went on to work for NASA and were beyond critical to getting the US's space program going.  Their crowning achievement was the Moon landing.  Without militarization, rocketry might have fizzled (hah) out after Goddard, and we might have no satellites at all in orbit.  

The Space Race was driven by politico-military competition between the US and the Soviet Union.  Without the threat of a peer adversary, do you think NASA would have gotten the funding it did?  Without militarization we would never have landed on the Moon.  

GPS was originally a military technology,  Its antecedents go back to the Navy's TRANSIT system.  The single only reason that billions of dollars in funding were originally provided for GPS development and launch was to enable SLBM targeting.  Without militarization, you'd be using paper maps and a compass.  

Many technologies originally developed for military purpose have dual use functionality.  Even more so than that, now that the global economy - and particularly the US one - is reliant on space to function, space has become a vital part of our national infrastructure, one that must be protected at all costs.  The costs of losing access to space are literally incalculable.

Many nations have assets in space that allow them to better navigate, collect imagery, produce different EMS effects, etc. 
GPS is not a civilian application. it has civilian applications, but it was not designed with civilian use in mind.

The US is designing a Space Force to better manage and protect the assets in space that are used for national defense. The very same way that other nations do. Creating a Space force allows for a special appropriation of monies from congress to better manage, protect, and develop space assets.

The major difference is that almost everything we know about the universe tells us we are right. We have an immense amount of data that indicated the standard model is correct, there are just a few niggling issues out there we just can’t explain. 

The last time physics hit this wall was in the late 1800’s when the Newtonian model of physics was perfected. There were just two questions that we didn’t have an answer for. 1) what happens at very high speeds (relativity), and 2) what happens at very small scales (quantum mechanics). Almost everything that has been done in physics since then has been in service to just those two questions. 

We now are starting to get a pretty good grasp on those, but they have led to a couple other issues we can’t explain at all.

 A unified theory of everything (combining relativity and quantum mechanics) simply doesn’t exist. The models they need to work are conflicting. 

Why is time Uno-directional. All physics equations work equally well in reverse if you time flows backwards. But we can’t explain why we only perceive time to flow in one direction. 

Where did all the anti-matter go? Making matter from nothing is doable, but it always pops into existence with an exactly equal amount of anti-matter. But the universe only contains matter, so where is all the antimatter?

Why is gravity so weak? We think of gravity as being powerful but it is trillions, or trillions of trillions times less powerful than the other forces. Why is this?

Let's look at one component. The capsule. Orion was announced May 24, 2011. Over 8.5 years ago. This work was based off of CEV which was announced January 2004.

The death of this reigning physics paradigm, the Standard Model, has been predicted for decades. There are hints of its problems in the physics we already have. Strange results from laboratory experiments suggest flickers of ghostly new species of neutrinos beyond the three described in the Standard Model. And the universe seems full of dark matter that no particle in the Standard Model can explain. 

But recent tantalizing evidence might one day tie those vague strands of data together: Three times since 2016, ultra-high-energy particles have blasted up through the ice of Antarctica, setting off detectors in the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, a machine dangling from a NASA balloon far above the frozen surface.

As Live Science reported in 2018, those events — along with several additional particles detected later at the buried Antarctic neutrino observatory IceCube — don't match the expected behavior of any Standard Model particles. The particles look like ultra high-energy neutrinos. But ultra high-energy neutrinos shouldn't be able to pass through the Earth. That suggests that some other kind of particle — one that's never been seen before — is flinging itself into the cold southern sky. 

Now, in a new paper, a team of physicists working on IceCube have cast heavy doubt on one of the last remaining Standard Model explanations for these particles: cosmic accelerators, giant neutrino guns hiding in space that would periodically fire intense neutrino bullets at Earth. A collection of hyperactive neutrino guns somewhere in our northern sky could have blasted enough neutrinos into Earth that we'd detect particles shooting out of the southern tip of our planet. But the IceCube researchers didn't find any evidence of that collection out there, which suggests new physics must be needed to explain the mysterious particles.

To understand why, it's important to know why these mystery particles are so unsettling for the Standard Model.

Neutrinos are the faintest particles we know about; they're difficult to detect and nearly massless. They pass through our planet all the time — mostly coming from the sun and rarely, if ever, colliding with the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up our bodies and the dirt beneath our feet.

But ultra-high-energy neutrinos from deep space are different from their low-energy cousins. Much rarer than low-energy neutrinos, they have wider ""cross sections,"" meaning they're more likely to collide with other particles as they pass through them. The odds of an ultra-high-energy neutrino making it all the way through Earth intact are so low that you'd never expect to detect it happening. That's why the ANITA detections were so surprising: It was as if the instrument had won the lottery twice, and then IceCube had won it a couple more times as soon as it started buying tickets.

And physicists know how many lottery tickets they had to work with. Many ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos come from the interactions of cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. Every once in a while, those cosmic rays interact with the CMB in just the right way to fire high-energy particles at Earth. This is called the ""flux,"" and it's the same all over the sky. Both ANITA and IceCube have already measured what the cosmic neutrino flux looks like to each of their sensors, and it just doesn't produce enough high-energy neutrinos that you'd expect to detect a neutrino flying out of Earth at either detector even once.

""If the events detected by ANITA belong to this diffuse neutrino component, ANITA should have measured many other events at other elevation angles,"" said Anastasia Barbano, a University of Geneva physicist who works on IceCube.

But in theory, there could have been  ultra-high-energy neutrino sources beyond the sky-wide flux, Barbano told Live Science: those neutrino guns, or cosmic accelerators. 

""If it is not a matter of neutrinos produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with the CMB, then the observed events can be either neutrinos produced by individual cosmic accelerators in a given time interval"" or some unknown Earthly source, Barbano said.

Blazars, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, starburst galaxies, galaxy mergers, and magnetized and fast-spinning neutron stars are all good candidates for those sorts of accelerators, she said. And we know that cosmic neutrino accelerators do exist in space;  in 2018, IceCube tracked a high-energy neutrino back to a blazar, an intense jet of particles coming from an active black hole at the center of a distant galaxy.

ANITA picks up only the most extreme high-energy neutrinos, Barbano said, and if the upward-flying particles were cosmic-accelerator-boosted neutrinos from the Standard Model — most likely tau neutrinos — then the beam should have come with a shower of lower-energy particles that would have tripped IceCube's lower-energy detectors.

""We looked for events in seven years of IceCube data,"" Barbano said — events that matched the angle and length of the ANITA detections, which you'd expect to find if there were a significant battery of cosmic neutrino guns out there firing at Earth to produce these up-going particles. But none turned up.

Their results don't completely eliminate the possibility of an accelerator source out there. But they do ""severely constrain"" the range of possibilities, eliminating all of the most plausible scenarios involving cosmic accelerators and many less-plausible ones.

""The message we want to convey to the public is that a Standard Model astrophysical explanation does not work no matter how you slice it,"" Barbano said.

Researchers don't know what's next. Neither ANITA nor IceCube is an ideal detector for the needed follow-up searches, Barbano said, leaving the researchers with very little data on which to base their assumptions about these mysterious particles. It's a bit like trying to figure out the picture on a giant jigsaw puzzle from just a handful of pieces.

Right now, many possibilities seem to fit the limited data, including a fourth species of ""sterile"" neutrino outside the Standard Model and a range of theorized types of dark matter. Any of these explanations would be revolutionary.hjh But none is strongly favored yet.

""We have to wait for the next generation of neutrino detectors,"" Barbano said.

I used to work for a small company that did a lot of SBIR programs for NASA. NASA sends out requests for proposals for a variety of different areas of research they are interested in. Companies write proposals and submit them and NASA determines who to award the contract to. The programs start at 6 months and go to 2 years if you reach the second phase and after that is commercialization. NASA puts a fairly big emphasis on commercialization and it's often obnoxious because you have to write parts of your proposal to somehow sell this very specific research as something that can be commercialized for terrestrial use. It's a hard thing to do when you're proposing a device designed to use solar energy to supply heat to a reactor that is extracting oxygen from lunar regolith for lunar bases.

The hard reality is, pure space exploration is rarely a profitable endeavor and if you're going to have private companies entering the fray, you're going to need to give them a profit motive. I think there's an inherent need and value for NASA to do a lot of the space exploration for the sake of exploration and the science for the sake of science thing, but there's also a need to give private companies a carrot on a stick in the form of monetary reward to drive some stuff forward and forward faster.

Disclaimer: This is coming from a wikipedia-level understanding of the topic and should be taken about as seriously as a creepypasta.

TL:DR; Idiot on the internet says the inside of a black hole and outside of a white hole are the same thing and that's what the universe is.

We live in a 4 dimensional universe: 3 spatial dimensions, 1 time dimension.

The time dimension isn't actually particularly unique. Except, movement (at the speed of light) in that dimension is compulsory. Life as we know it has simply evolved in this environment, and so we happen to experience this compulsory movement in the time direction as, well, time.

The event horizon of a black hole is essentially the threshold when the compulsory-movement dimension is no longer the one we're used to (""time""), but one of our 3 dimensions becomes the compulsory-movement dimension. In other words, toward the ""center"" of the black hole, upon crossing the event horizon, IS the compulsory direction while inside the black hole. It's not physically possible, or causally possible, to exit the event horizon.

Thing is, you can't actually reach the center, either. Because on the other side of the event horizon, the travel from the edge of the event horizon to the center/singularity is TIME. What we call ""time"" actually becomes a spatial dimension inside the black hole.

If you think about this for a moment, you'll realize that objects falling into a black hole fall in at the same location but at different times. On the inside of the event horizon, this means that the objects have fallen in at different locations but at the same time.

Furthermore, the closer you are to a black hole, the more of your world line (possible actions) takes you to the center. In other words, the closer you are, the less possible directions you could travel to get away. In other words, just outside the edge of the event horizon, the only possible escape is directly away from the event horizon at nearly the speed of light.

In other and stranger words, this means the spatial size of the event horizon gets larger and larger from your reference point. This also means that as you cross the event horizon, the spatial size of our universe gets smaller and smaller relative to your reference point.

Okay, okay. So, a visualization. There's a black hole, and you can see the event horizon. So you approach it. The event horizon starts to look bigger and bigger. Not just because you're closer. Like, it's actually growing in size. Eventually, it gets so bizarrely large that the outer edge seems to expand *behind* you. You look back, and the edges just seem to continue overtaking your home universe. And your universe starts to look like a white circle, a white event horizon of sorts. So what was once the ""center"" of the black hole is now *every outward direction away from your home universe*. Your home universe becomes a sphere, with an apparent center, that you can no longer go back and reach again. Entering that white sphere would be equivalent to escaping the black hole's event horizon.

At least that's what you would see in a naive simulation.

But remember the flip of compulsory-movement dimension? And remember that on the outside of the black hole, everything enters at the same location but at different times? But from inside the black hole, everything appears at the same time, suddently, but in different locations, expanding out infinitely from a point?

You can't actually ""look back"" at the white sphere I mentioned earlier, either. To do that you would have to look backwards in time. Can't be done. A more complete simulation would show you entering a black hole, and at the moment of crossing the event horizon, a sudden intense ""flash"" of energy of everything that has ever fallen into the black hole appearing all at once and expanding in every direction.

Yeah. That starts to sound like a while hole. And it starts to sound an awful lot like the big bang. And it starts to sound like our universe is a white hole.

Why can't something escape a black hole? Because that's the equivalent of us attempting to travel to the big bang. That can only be done by traveling backwards in time, which can only be done by traveling faster than the speed of light.

So, yeah. If we could travel back in time to the big bang, somehow survive the intense energy and somehow survive the primordial absence of physical laws that keep matter held together, somehow continue traveling back in time before that initial moment... Then we would have escaped a black hole's event horizon, and emerge from that black hole and into our parent universe.",,1580148134,{},ffr1322,False,t3_euqao4,False,True,t1_ffr09z0,/r/space/comments/euqao4/how_do_we_know_that_the_universe_hasnt_been/ffr1322/,1580148138,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

The thing is that physics can’t really look back this far. We live in a universe with constants, things like the speed of light, the gravitational constant, electromagnetic constants, etc... there are a number of them. But there is evidence that these constants were not necessary, and may have been in flux at the moment of the Big Bang, and only solidified into their current state after it occurred. Basically the universe could have looked very different than it does, and so far as we know there is no physical necessity that required these constants to look the way they do.

There are alternative theories, such as the Cyclical Universe theory which states that after expanding forever we reach another “bang” and create another universe.

We want the hook end to move at half orbital velocity at this point, so we can supply half the speed via rocket and the other half via skyhook. With a circumference of 2200km, that's a rotation period of ~10 minutes. When attaching to the hook you'd be moving at the same speed it does, so unless you're doing anything wrong, there's no immediate jerk, and the rest is just a centrifugal force calculation. The formula for centrigual acceleration is `a = v^2 / r`, and we know `v=3.75km/s` and `r=350km` from above. This ends up at ~40m/s^2, or about 4G.

4G is outside where you'd expect a regular airliner to break, and it's going to be an uncomfortable experience for any passengers. (normal take off is ~1.1G, so only 0.1g above normal). We can assume passengers would be optimally oriented so as to take G-forces, and it appears humans can take 6G for at least ten minutes when the force is perpendicular to the spine, without loss of cognitive facilities or lasting damage.

For example NSTAR, 3 engines pushed the DAWN probe, it has a power of 2.6 kW and used for 24 hours it consumes 300 g of Xenon.

The new PPE that will push the Gateway has a total of 49 kW engines and consumes 8 kg of Xenon per day.

The X3 engine (XR-100 for AR) ran at 102 kW but can reach 200 kW (at 800 V) or 250 kW (at 1000 V). In the world there is no vacuum chamber that allows you to test it at maximum power

1 X3 at 1000v = 100 NSTAR

*****

I come to your objection

First of all, without an engine like the X3, you don't have the possibility of reaching powers for which nuclear power exceeds solar power.

In my opinion, the problem is not in NASA trying to continue a line of development, but in the American presidents who change objectives at each change (I am a European observer, but trump is at the third objective in 3 years.

First is the effects of relativity on the speed of light. Since you’re referencing “it’s” time dilation, I’m assuming you’re referring to the distant object. Unfortunately, the relativistic motion of the remote object wouldn’t effect how long it takes for the time to reach us. The speed of light is constant in any given reference frame. That means that once the light is emitted from the object (likely at a very high blue or redshift) it would still take the light the same amount of time to reach us. The speed of light is always the same, and thus the rate at which information can reach us from a distance is always capped by that speed.

Secondly, the fact that the remote object is relativistic does not change the fact that we are not. For example, just because we observe a supernova in another galaxy (which has ejecta at significant fractions of the speed of light) doesn’t  mean that the properties of our local space time will change.

If light is traveling at a constant rate, and the universe has been in existence for 13.8 billion years, the photons would have to be massively accelerated to reach us from anything greater than 13.8 billion light years away.

No, they have not been accelerated they just had to cover a longer distance to reach our region. They are here much later than expected. That's because the universe expanded all the time while the light was traveling towards us at lightspeed. So the light had to cover much longer distance to finally reach us. 

And at the same time the expansion little by little stretched the light to longer and longer wavelengths and it experienced *redshift* (not to be confused with Doppler shift which is different physical process).

In cosmology there's different measures of distance for different things. In following example I'll use this nifty standard model cosmology calculator: http://astro.ucla.edu/%7Ewright/ACC.html

Note that results depend on which cosmology you use and parameters in your model. For example open and flat universes give you different results as does different values for density parameter Ω and Hubble's constant H0. I'll just leave them in their default values for standard cosmology.

**Let's say we observe a very distant galaxy with redshift of z=7. What is the distance to it?**

The galaxy emitted that light about 13 billion years ago when the universe was only about 0.77 billion years old. Then the universe was much denser than today and has been expanding since. So those days the galaxy was much closer to us. How close?

**Angular distance is 3.6 billion light years**  

This is how the distant object looks like to us in size. To put it simply: see a galaxy close to you and it looks big, see a galaxy far away and it looks small. That gives you angular distance.

This is how the galaxy looked like 13 billion years ago when the light was emitted towards our region in space. So we now see the galaxy as it was 13 billion years ago.

Yet it doesn't look like a galaxy 13 billion light years away form us. It looks big as a galaxy much closer to us. In size it looks like a galaxy that should be just 3.6 billion light years away. What's up with that?

It looks bigger because when the light was emitted 13 billion years ago the galaxy was much closer to our region in space. We see it now as it was then. And then it was much closer only 3.6 bn light years away.

But if it was only 3.6 bn light years away then why it took 13 bn years for the light to reach us?

Because universe has been expanding. All that time light has been traveling towards us the space in between has been expanding. So for the light the journey got much longer. Eventually the light had to travel 13 bn light years to finally reach us. And that took 13 bn years. 

And over the years and distance the expansion of universe also affected the light. Little by little it got stretched with space, and bit by bit its wavelength became longer, which means redder. The light got *redshifted* (note, that is very different process from Doppler shift which is about speed).

**Comoving distance is 28.8 billion light years**  

This is the current distance to the galaxy with the expansion of the universe in the standard model. This is how far away it currently is. We of course cannot now see it as it currently is. That would take 28.8 bn years plus all the delay caused by expansion of the universe.",,1580135973,{},ffqj25t,False,t3_euaz78,False,True,t1_ffnmpje,/r/space/comments/euaz78/ask_ethan_how_can_we_see_461_billion_lightyears/ffqj25t/,1580135974,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

In fact, up to power levels of about 300 kW – 400 kW, solar powerwill probably be the preferred alternative. Above 500 kW, there is a tradeoff between solar and nuclear power. Andthat is where the use of NEP designs starts to become viable.

And with of the cold nights (as far as I remember/if I remember right), it could reach a moment in which the energy wouldn't be enough to heat the systems on stand by, waiting for the sun to rise, damaging the hardware and thus killing the Curiosity because of the low temperatures.

But one thing that stuck to me and wasn't answered is that, indeed on mars, the robot got, day by day, with a lot of dust on it. And it caused a real problem because it affected the performance of the solar panels. And with of the cold nights (as far as I remember/if I remember right), it could reach a moment in which the energy wouldn't be enough to heat the systems on stand by, waiting for the sun to rise, damaging the hardware and thus killing the Curiosity because of the low temperatures. My question is, why didn't they think about some kind of system that wipes, at least part, of the dust accumulated on top of the solar panels? It's such a problem that that's very hard, or impossible? Or maybe was just something that they didn't think of? Quite intrigued by this, since the documentary.

Weight (force) is relative, but mass is not. The rover will always have ~900kg of mass wherever it goes, but will ""weigh"" differently depending on what planetary body it's stationed on.


This gets particularly annoying in the imperial measurement system because while kg is a unit of mass, saying something is X amount of pounds (lb) can be ambiguous as pounds are both unit of mass AND a unit of force (lbm vs lbf). Luckily NASA uses SI units in general which helps reduce the ambiguity, but they're still in the US so it's tough to break away from understanding everything through a lens of imperial measurements.


But to answer your question, the rover weighs about a third of what it did on Earth when it's on Mars, about 660 lbf.",,1580128853,{},ffqb2sq,False,t3_euf4np,False,True,t1_ffq89mt,/r/space/comments/euf4np/curiosity_after_more_than_7_years_on_mars/ffqb2sq/,1580128854,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

Mars ""dust devils"" are really tiny, concentrated and fairly stable whirlwinds. Get a whirlwind passing directly overhead of something, and it picks up the dust under it and pulls it off, mostly sideways since that dust is heavier than air, but a tiny amount goes up into the vortex and makes it visible.

Since the solar tray is a little bit off the ground and quite smooth, the wind sweeps it fairly clear of dust, in the same way your blowing some spilled sugar off a smooth tablecloth clears it of sugar quite effectively. The removed dust then mostly falls to ground level and then blows along the surface, although a little could get sucked way up in the sky and fall everywhere over time.

Now as the dust devil leaves the rover, most of the dust that was on the rover's higher and smooth surface is lower than it is, and so very little gets redeposited on that surface, and so now it's cleaner.

They also have a website called the [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/) where they have the raw data from every instrument on every mission available.

But people were enthralled by the promises, and they pretended they represented reality, for a while. Everyone put their eggs in the Shuttle's basket, it became the primary launch system for all payloads in the ""free world"". Commercial, military, scientific, all of it. But in order to fulfill its promises the Shuttle would have to fly dozens of times a year too reach the cost figures. In practice NASA heavily subsidized launches and operations. In practice each launch cost around 1 to 2 billion, which none of the commercial customers could hope to pay.

But doing the missions gave the Shuttle a purpose and allowed room for the polite fiction that ""real soon now"" the Shuttle would hit it's stride and live up to its promise. That was part of the very pressure that resulted in the choice to launch Challenger, which ultimately revealed the fragility and limitations of the system, and brought down to Earth the really that it could never meet its promises, not by huge factors.

Hubble servicing missions continued, still hugely subsidized by NASA human spaceflight, partly because they showed off what astronauts could do and have some justification for keeping the Shuttle around.",,1580119545,{},ffq47mw,False,t3_eue3g6,False,True,t1_ffpayey,/r/space/comments/eue3g6/astronaut_dale_a_gardner_wearing_the_manned/ffq47mw/,1580119546,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

6014,[],,ianindy,,,[],,,,text,t2_dh79d,False,False,[],"The term ""observable universe"" takes into account the positions of obects as they are today, not just the time it took for light to reach us. It isn't just that the light travels for 13.8 billion years. That only tells you how long ago the light left the object. They can observe the redshift and determine how fast the viewed object/galaxy is moving away from us. This is then used to determine how far away that object is *now*. It is how we can picture the universe as it looks today. The furthest objects are 46 billion light years away, and the furthest objects are moving away at a rate of more than 6 light years every year. That's the current limit of the observable universe. In time I think the top limit if the observable universe could expand to 60 billion? light years, but after that the speed of expansion beats light speed by a large factor. As space expands we won't be able to see those distant objects any longer.
 
 
 If the universe is infinite, there is a lot we will never see. But, if it is finite, and has a boundary, then it is possible for the entire universe to be *smaller* than the observable universe! Why? Light bends due to gravity, and we may be seeing some galaxies two or more times, in different parts of their development,and not realize it because the photons are taking different paths to get to us. In a closed system like that, you may even be able to view the Milky Way as it looked 10 billion years ago, but it may be unrecognizable because it would appear completely different than it is today.
 
 
Sorry if I didn't make sense. I am no expert, and may be mistaken. I just like space a lot and love to ponder these giant confusing concepts.

6386,[],,Gohron,,,[],,,,text,t2_46hn73qd,False,False,[],"It most certainly wouldn’t.  Iron is very heavy while something like Titanium or Aluminum is not only lighter but also much stronger.  I’ve long worked as a chef and some places I’ve worked have used cast iron hot plates or pans and they are far heavier than the steel ones.  With our current launch system infrastructure that’s in place, weight reduction is one of the most important aspects of the vehicles and equipment we build for space travel or exploration.  It takes quite a bit of energy to get something small up to escape velocity or even orbital velocity, no less something that weighs thousands of pounds.

I’m sure in the future (as in the next 100 years, hopefully sooner), we will have engineered and built new launch systems and orbital infrastructure that will allow us to put much larger things into space than we do now and probably even be much easier than it is currently for us to put smaller payloads up there.  I personally think that infrastructure built on the Moon will eventually serve as staging area for long range journeys and probably even the place where these larger ships are built as the moon is dramatically easier to launch from due to the low gravity.  I’d love to see people on Mars and I’d likely be screaming and jumping around like a maniac when we all hear the first signal from the landing vehicle announcing “touchdown”.  I also think we will see a Mars mission in the next couple of decades, however I think we’d be better served by working to industrialize the moon in a serious manner before we attempt to send anyone to Mars, but the symbolism of it will likely outweigh the notion of building up the Moon for the time being.

I don’t think that those politicians pushing for a Mars mission currently have fully grasped just what we will need to develop in order to make it work and bring our people home successfully and healthy.  You’re going to need a spaceship with extensive radiation shielding for its crew and almost certainly will need a rotating section of the ship to create gravity unless our astronauts have no issue with permanently destroying their bodies to an extent (maybe even fatally) we have not yet seen in any of our other space travelers.  Scott Kelly spent a year in space (along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko) and was compared to his identical twin brother, Joe Kelly (also a retired astronaut) upon his return.  He suffered quite a bit of negative effects to his health due to being in space without gravity for so long.  The point is that despite the technology existing in the 1970s for a manned Mars mission, that even 50 years later, building your spaceship and equipment and planning out your mission is a very large undertaking, much larger than anything else we have done in regards to manned flights.  Getting to Mars with people will allow for more comprehensive scientific study of the planet and will prove that human beings are capable of traveling to (and surviving) other worlds (a major symbolic event, perhaps the biggest ever in our history) so it’s far from a wasted trip but Mars doesn’t exactly serve a useful purpose to us outside of what I mentioned.    Perhaps one day, it could be an exotic destination for Earthers looking to travel or settle elsewhere.  However, by the time we’re able to regularly move lots of people back and forth to Mars and establish a sustainable colony/base, I’m sure we will have the means to build space habitats that people could live on.  Other than being another planet that people may want to go to simply because it would be an exotic location or they want to live a “frontier” type life, I don’t think there will ever be a necessity for people to move to Mars to deal with overpopulation.

In chemistry, an oxidizing agent (oxidant, oxidizer) is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances — in other words to accept their electrons. Common oxidizing agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the halogens.

In one sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that undergoes a chemical reaction in which it gains one or more electrons. In that sense, it is one component in an oxidation–reduction (redox) reaction.

There's basically nothing between us and the probe. About as much atmosphere as would be between you and someone a couple miles away and that's basically it.

Next, the transmitter on the probe transmits at several times the power of your cell phone.

That transmission is also pointed directly back at the earth in a fairly narrow beam, thanks to the big parabolic dishon the probe. Your phone broadcasts in all directions at once, wasting most of the energy.

On the receiving end here on earth, we listen to the signal using a network of *sixty-meter* parabolic collectors. So they gather a huge amount of signal from a very narrow slice of the sky. Cell phone antennas have a vastly smaller collecting area and are non-directional.

The oscillators, DACs, etc. on each end are extremely high quality and produce a very stable, clean signal.

That signal also doesn't have to share the region of the radio spectrum with a ton of other cell phones and devices. The transmitter and receiver are only listening to each other at any given moment, like having a one-on-one conversation in a quiet room.

To send a signal back to the probe, the system works the same in reverse, but we can transmit with much higher power to ensure that the probe's smaller receiver dish can hear it clearly.

Now, despite all this the datarates at the distance that New Horizons is at are *extremely slow* -- perhaps 1,000 or 2,000 bits per second. We would never tolerate such slow speeds from our phones, but it's necessary for distant probes to ensure that the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough we can hear the probe (and the probe can hear us!) above the background noise.",,1580098942,{},ffpmqy5,False,t3_eu6rp5,False,True,t1_ffmclxj,/r/space/comments/eu6rp5/high_resolution_picture_of_charon/ffpmqy5/,1580105088,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

Curiosity is a massive rover and weighs just shy of a ton. It's like landing a small car from space. Balloons weren't going to cut it for this one, especially with the added complexity.


So what did NASA/JPL decide to do? A fucking [Sky Crane](https://youtu.be/h2I8AoB1xgU). Not only do you have to get this thing built, launched on a 9 month journey from Earth to Mars, and inserted correctly in a Martian orbit, which is a MASSIVE technical achievement in its own right, but then you have to land the damn thing. And instead of balloons, it has a whole separate descent stage that slows the rover down to the point where it's hovering above the Martian surface. The rover pops out of this assembly and is lowered with cables to the ground, and then the ""crane"" flies away. If it gets too close and kicks up too much debris, it's game over for the science sensors on the rover. If it has too much horizontal speed when dropping the rover, game over. If things get tangled or it accidentally clips the rover - game over.

Isolation is not something to take lightly. We're social animals. Solitary confinement has serious long term effects on your mental health, which is why it's being banned in many prisons.

In the case of a mars mission, you wouldn't be alone though. You'd have your crew with you, but putting 4 or 5 people in extremely tight quarters, completely isolated from the rest of humanity, in an extremely dangerous situation, with a very heavy workload, could potentially lead to a breakdown of the command structure, as we saw with the skylab mutiny. A bunch of physically fit 20-somethings trapped in close proximity, completing complex/stressful tasks is a common setup for reality TV shows, and that's for good reason. It's a situation where people break down quickly. People turn on one another, couples form, cliques and alliances happen, and drama flourishes.

Nasa is taking these issues pretty seriously. There's a cool podcast called The Habitat where they gave a training group of astronaut hopefuls recorders to talk about their experiences in a simulated mars base if you're curious about it. 

I'm not saying a mission to mars is impossible, but it may simply be unrealistic due to all the hurdles we'll need to jump over. Eventually we might invent elegant solutions to every problem using yet-unseen technologies, but that could be decades, or even centuries away. I just don't want people to get their hopes up for people to be on mars by 2030. Looking at problems realistically saves you from a lot of disappointment. With all the challenges involved, and the lack of evidence of life so far, I just don't see any country throwing tens of billions at the problem.

One other point is that for the things like the legs/arms that deploy, the harness needs to be able to flex.

We may have to face a sad reality though: Getting to mars might just be unrealistic. The cosmic radiation is a problem we currently don't have any solution for, so anyone who takes the trip is putting their health in serious jeapordy. Once there, the planet isn't particularly welcoming. Poison soil, lack of air, lack of water, and the explorers would be extremely isolated from any outside help. Any mission would span years, and the psychological effects of isolation for that long could be downright traumatic.

I love the idea of going to Mars, but it may simply not be feasable. A much better goal for now would be permanently inhabiting the moon. Natural caves could provide adequate protection from radiation, and the moon's resources have a ton of potential uses, including fueling rockets for missions further out into the solar system. The moon would give us a testbed for all the technology we'd need on Mars, and is close enough that the astronauts could get home in a few days if something went wrong.

A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG, RITEG) is an electrical generator that uses an array of thermocouples to convert the heat released by the decay of a suitable radioactive material into electricity by the Seebeck effect. This generator has no moving parts.

RTGs have been used as power sources in satellites, space probes, and uncrewed remote facilities such as a series of lighthouses built by the former Soviet Union inside the Arctic Circle. RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred watts (or less) of power for durations too long for fuel cells, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where solar cells are not practical.

A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG, RITEG) is an electrical generator that uses an array of thermocouples to convert the heat released by the decay of a suitable radioactive material into electricity by the Seebeck effect. This generator has no moving parts.

RTGs have been used as power sources in satellites, space probes, and uncrewed remote facilities such as a series of lighthouses built by the former Soviet Union inside the Arctic Circle. RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred watts (or less) of power for durations too long for fuel cells, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where solar cells are not practical.

No. When I posted this I assumed that people would  think deeper a little bit, but just to clarify, it is essential to OUR life right now, never said that it was essential if we evolved without these factors, only that we wouldn't have made it far enough to evolve into what we are today.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer\_plaque#Sun\_and\_galactic\_landmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque#Sun_and_galactic_landmarks)

&gt;The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics)). Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) of [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar), using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy)) of the launch can be calculated from these values.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the** [**Sun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)**. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the** [**galactic plane**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane)**.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory) shows its way past [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) and out of the Solar System.

No it isn't.  It's crucial for some ecosystems on earth, but only because they adapted themselves to the existence of the moon.  If the moon wasn't there they'd just adapt themselves to the nonexistence of the moon,

&gt;I meant as in their extremely strong gravitational pull helps maintain life, if there was no Jupiter, we wouldn't die, because we would never be born, the gaseous planet has caught comets and asteroids in the past that would've destroyed life on earth.

Jupiter may have deflected asteroids and comets in the past, but there's also evidence it caused mass extinctions by sending them towards us.  The influence of Jupiter has been massively overblown by a lot of space documentaries.  And the other planets do even less, you could erase all of them from existence and nothing would change for us.

&gt;atmosphere protects us from radiation and the extreme heat the sun emits

Without an atmosphere the earth would be colder, not hotter.  The atmosphere traps the heat.  Also life can be very resistant to radiation if it needs to be.

&gt;And lastly, not every planet has a sun. They have a star. 

The sun is a star, a star is a sun.  Every star gives off light and heat and allows for photosynthesis.  So every planet has an equivalent to the sun, even if it's obviously not the same one as ours.

It seems like what you're doing is looking at all the characteristics of earth and assuming they're all essential to life.  They're not.  Many of them didn't even exist when life formed, or at least not in the same way.  I completely understand the premise of the post, my point is that these factors aren't acting together and aren't essential to each other, or necessarily essential for life.  Some of them are essential for life on earth, but only because life on earth evolved to require them.  If they weren't there life on earth would have just evolved to not require them.

There's even life on earth right now that doesn't require most or all of these factors.  The stuff that lives at deep ocean trenches would survive if earth didn't have a sun, a moon, or an atmosphere.  Those ecosystems would survive for billions of years if the earth was flung completely out of the solar system.  And the reason it doesn't require those factors is they don't apply to the bottom of the ocean, so that life didn't evolve to require them.",,1580090945,{},ffpbjgt,False,t3_eu6co3,False,True,t1_ffpa81c,/r/space/comments/eu6co3/is_life_a_coincident/ffpbjgt/,1580099694,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

They don't look fake, you just have no other frame of reference for what a real rover on Mars looks like besides movies and television which actually *are* fake so maybe it's because you're comparing it to that.

This word gets thrown around a lot, but it's essentially just taken similar to how your phone's panorama feature works by stitching together several pictures.

All of them are real unless they're indicated as an artist's interpretation or animation. Those labels don't always make it to Reddit posts but the source of pictures is always clearly defined on NASA's sites.

Charon, also known as (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It has a mean radius of 606 km (377 mi). It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).

Firstly without the moon the tides would lessen which wouldn't affect us, but it would greatly affect coastal ecosystems survival which then would affect land mammals, the absence of the moon would affect the weather insanely, the moon is crucial for life.

Xennials (also known as the Oregon Trail Generation and Generation Catalano) are the micro-generation of people on the cusp of the Generation X and Millennial demographic cohorts, typically born in the late 1970s to early 1980s.  Xennials are described as having had an analog childhood and a digital adulthood.

In 2017, Xennial was included in Merriam-Webster's ""Words We're Watching"" section, which discusses new words which are increasingly being used, but which do not yet meet criteria for a dictionary entry.

It's fascinating how long these missions can carry out after the planned lifecycle is exceeded. The rover Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to save power.

One thing to note before starting: the projectile should have some small amount of propulsion on board to raise its periapsis otherwise most trajectories will leave you escaping lunar orbit entirely or crashing back into the ground

&gt; What kind of power would the mass driver need 

Depending on exactly what kind of orbit you want that lump of metal to end up in it should take somewhere in the neighborhood of a few gigajoules of energy

&gt;and what length should it be in order to deliver the payload? 

For a solid block of titanium it could be quite short, a longer acceleration keeps the g-forces lower so you need a longer gun if you want to launch more delicate objects

Some life on earth requires tides, but tides aren't required for life in general.

&gt;the other planets for earth's gravity and to catch asteroids

I'm not sure what you mean by ""for earths gravity"", the other planets have nothing to do with that.  And while Jupiter does keep the asteroid belt in check, it's also possible for it to fling asteroids towards the inner solar system.

&gt;oxygen and the atmosphere to keep radiation at bay and give us a comfortable temperature

We don't know how rare thick atmospheres are, that might not be particularly special.  And oxygen wasn't always there, it was actually created in the atmosphere by life after photosynthesis evolved.

And every solar system has a goldilocks zone, that's not unique at all.  Even in our solar system Mars is also in the goldilocks zone.

&gt;the sun to provide life

Almost every planet has a sun, except for the ones that were flung out of their solar system.

You're neglecting to include a term for the cross-section of a neutrino. The 1e45 watts of energy you're talking about is carried by neutrinos, which interact lightly with matter (to put it.... lightly). If the energy was to be delivered by something like EM radiation (which interacts strongly with matter), you may have more grounded fears of being toasted. Neutrinos mostly just blast right through us without transferring any energy. For example, we can run the same calculation with solar flux.

Most of the neutrino flux on earth comes from the sun. Roughly 1e15 per square meter per second. The energy of the bulk of these is roughly in the 400keV range. If we convert this to energy flux, it comes to about 64W/m\^2.

But the absorption rate of neutrinos in an atom which interacts ""strongly"" with neutrinos is roughly 10 SNU (solar neutrino units)  
[http://www.sns.ias.edu/\~jnb/Papers/Popular/Scientificamerican69/scientificamerican69.html](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/Papers/Popular/Scientificamerican69/scientificamerican69.html)  
A SNU is one capture per second per 1e36 atoms.

Let's then use this number to determine how much of that 64 W/m\^2 from the sun is absorbed by a cubic meter of seawater (assuming all atoms of the water absorbed neutrinos as strongly). 1 cubic meter of water contains roughly 1e29 atoms. Divide that by the SNU and we get an expected 1 detection every 1e7 seconds. The number of neutrinos blasting through it is 1e15/s. The fraction of neutrinos which interact with that 1 cubic meter is then 1/1e15\*1e7 = 1e-22.

For the sun's output, that would mean a 1m\^3 volume of water would not absorb the full 64W, but only about 6e-21 W.

Apply this absorption rate to the neutrino flux at the surface of the earth from Betelgeuse blowing up, and the power is reduced from 2e6 W/m\^2 to 2e-16W/m\^2.

Again, not a storm, but...

It's heavily debated and likely will never be known if the GRS has actually stuck around for 355 years. Robert Hooke saw something that looked very much like the GRS in 1664, and Giovanni Cassini definitely saw it in 1665.

However, it's heavily debated if it was the *same* Great Red Spot back then, or a separate vortex. It was observed continuously from 1665 until 1713, when suddenly the region clouded over and the vortex was not seen again for over a century.

The Great Red Spot was suddenly spotted again in 1830, and has been observed continuously until today...but again, was it the same vortex that Cassini saw? Or did the old one dissipate and a new one form a century later?

**Image Details**

A solar prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the sun's surface. Prominences are anchored to the sun's surface in the photosphere (sun's visible surface), and extend outwards into the sun's hot outer atmosphere, called the corona.

It was a challenging day when I captured this. Seeing conditions were not ideal. This animation was captured over a 65 minute period and contains 95 frames.

Follow me on Instagram [**@chucksastrophotography**](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) if you would like to know what's possible to be captured from our own backyard and the telescopes I use.

* Tharsis would be a very dry, cold desert even after terraforming.

* The Southern ice cap would probably be very big since the South pole is very landlocked - even moreso than our own.

* A lot of the rest of Mars would have intense and extensive monsoon seasons because of the temperature difference between the land in the South and the ocean in the North.

* The Boreal Ocean would probably end up with very large storms compared to the oceans of Earth, because of the lack of land North of 50 degrees latitude.

It's not clear what the climate around Hellas or Argyre Planitia would be - it would depend on how big the Southern ice cap gets.

The other thing affecting how Mars would look from space would be the colour of the vegetation picked.

I investigated both of these and found the common thread:  SEP was forced into both missions and that is what ruined them.

It's established protocol for gas giants, where solid body rotation usually doesn't work. 

Note that Jupiter's core, its equator, and its poles all rotate at different speeds, and so three different rotational systems are used. The standard for measuring System III rotation (the deep interior) is to watch the magnetic field.

This only works, though, if the magnetic poles are tilted to the rotational pole, so that way there's a bit of wobble to the field that we can measure. In the unusual case of Saturn, the magnetic poles and rotational poles are perfectly aligned (we don't know why), and so there is no wobble and this method doesn't work; instead, we rely on [other methods](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Natur.460..608R/abstract).

I guess the original train of this post, though, was more about how it would be if it had a different start, rather than starting from now.

The one major thing it would have needed to stay habitable would simply be **more mass.**

The low mass means lower gravity, so it's harder to hold onto lighter elements (H going to space), and it has less resources to put into the atmosphere, AND its core froze/solidified faster as it was smaller and had less pressure on it, thus no more magnetosphere to stop the solar win stripping away the atmosphere.",,1580072911,{},ffo0j9r,False,t3_eu6juq,False,True,t1_ffmeovd,/r/space/comments/eu6juq/this_would_be_mars_if_it_still_had_a_magnetic/ffo0j9r/,1580078999,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

It's easy to see why you would think that, but actually, no, it's quite safe to launch nuclear thermal rockets.


When a nuclear thermal rocket is first built and launched, the reactor core contains nearly pure Uranium 235, which emits relatively safe alpha particles and is only mildly radioactive.  The radiation hazard it poses is similar to that of the Plutonium 238 at the core of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG) which NASA has been launching for 50 years.


It is only once the nuclear thermal rocket is safely delivered to orbit and system checks are performed that it is activated.  Once activated, the nuclear fission reaction begins and the core of Uranium begins to create the dangerous, highly-radioactive fission products that must be contained.

What I should've said is that *I think it's better* to take smaller steps and start experimenting once you're confident enough in your skills and knowledge of basic rules (fundamentals) regarding art. If you start experimenting right away you might miss some important steps along the way and/or continue to reinforce some bad habits. Then when someone points them out you'll always go on the defensive claiming ""that's just my style"".

Also helpful constructive criticism is very hard to come by. Personally I wish I would receive much more of it instead of another ""wow this looks great"".

You need to remember that learning any art form is a long arduous process, and almost always there's someone else that has already gone through those steps.

So each camera has an eye (the sensor). The longer the expsosure the more light. However, you also get some blurring effect with moving objects. [Example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQl9T8RCwmfwal-VDV6-yVwBJfZMutGq2oA5d2T0RPpkMkF1Mdf) . Long expsosures are good as it gathers more light and these galaixes are very faint in the sky, so you want to capture as much as possible. There is a catch though, the sky moves. If you just took a long expsosure of the night sky it would blur as the stars move. 



To combat this, you use a star tracker. These rotate the camera in the opposite direction as the earth spins, so it cancels out the movement. This keeps the image still, so you can take long expsosures. With one, you can do expsosures up to 10minutes where as without one you can only do a few seconds. In this case, OP used 30second expsoures. 



However, in the title OP said many hours of data. This is where stacking is involved. If you take a bunch of small photos, and stack each one on top you can improve the image. Every photo has this thing called noise, and thats this [weird grainy effect.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQdo_dsYT8LNGrFb3aOjKs56m64lvD1Pm8vxDRqu20G7wCoXDpL) Also high altitude winds can make images look blurry. 


To combat this you 'stack' the images. Since the distortions and noise is completely random, you can essentially find the 'true' value of a pixel by finding average of it.  However to find an average you need lots of data, which is why you take lots of photos. For an example to find the average age of a classroom you don't take 2 pupils dates, but maybe 15. Same thing. 


Once you have stacked it, you then have an image which is a lot 'cleaner'. Then you use Photoshop to bring out the colours.

Airy-0 is a crater on Mars whose location defined the position of the prime meridian of that planet. It is about 0.5 kilometres (0.31 mi) across and lies within the larger crater Airy in the region Sinus Meridiani. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements has now recommended setting the longitude of the Viking 1 lander (47°.95137 west) as the standard.  This deﬁnition maintains the position of the center of Airy-0 at 0° longitude, within the tolerance of current cartographic uncertainties.Merton Davies tied this crater into an extensive geodetic control network of the planet Mars based on Mariner 9 and earlier photographs.

Say we invent instant teleportation, there would be major downsides when reaching our destination due to velocity and how everything in the universe is moving.  
   
scenario one: The best case, your velocity at point A will match velocity at point B because Point B's device will translate your velocity upon teleportation. Thank god because shit will get nasty and dangerous due to relative velocities.
  
Scenario two: Your velocity at point A will remain unchanged when you teleport to point B. Meaning since earth is moving at 460 meters a second, when you exit on say Jupiter, everything on the planet is coming at you at 11,944 meters per second!  That's like getting on the freeway going 10 miles an hour while everyone is flying past you at 80mph. A cool ass graphic showing the two rotational speeds. https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3609
  
Then there's scenario 3, the worst case scenario. Say teleportation sets your velocity to 0, a pure universal 0 velocity. Because all speed is relative, and frankly earth is a very fast moving train that we are all riding. Imagine jumping off that train and onto the dirt!  Not only is earth rotating at 0.5km a second, its also going around the sun 29km a second. So Jumping from point a, to point b just here on earth would hit you with a 67,000mph speed difference if your universal velocity was reset to zero. 
  
Or in similar fashion, you trying to jump onto a train coming at you 67,000 mph. Since one way of looking at teleportation would be like jumping from a stationary platform onto a moving train, or as in scenario 2, jumping from a moving car onto a moving train.
  
the universe is awesome because here we are. moving through space at 67,000mph and yet we feel as we are standing still.",,1580060899,{},ffn11zc,False,t3_eu69sh,False,True,t1_fflygjv,/r/space/comments/eu69sh/jupiter_rotates_so_fast_i_almost_imaged_the_whole/ffn11zc/,1580062414,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,

There are species that exist that have a far greater effect on this planet than we do.  You say that they have the right to exist, or that they have a purpose or a place in this world, but then again, so do we.

If you want to talk about what ""Mother Nature"" wants, then perhaps she -wants- us to cut down trees and create clearings.  Trees cut out light, shut out other species, and can create barren spaces where nothing else can grow. IE, ""Pine Barrens"". Having an unending, unbroken world forest is and would be B.A.D. for most other plants and animals.

Deer and other species flourish when they have open spaces - not necessarily grassy plains, but clearings. Saplings, shrubs, and other low growth are more easily consumed and nutritious than trying to gnaw on tree bark.  They love the edges of crop fields where ""stuff"" is starting to grow in.

Perhaps Mother Nature -created- us as another means of keeping forests constrained, in addition to lightning.  We can keep things thinned out regardless, unlike lightning where the environment has to be tinder-dry for it to work.  No other species can do that, and it's beneficial for many species that we do that.  Think of us as a complement to Beaver. The dammed areas they create turn into meadows - perfect for other wildlife.  We cut down overgrown forests - that then turn into meadows.

In addition, when/if we manage to move off of this planet, we will be taking the biosphere with us - to (re)create worlds that would otherwise never have life.  What other species can do that?  Once again, perhaps we were created by Mother Nature with that mission.  To carry plants and animals with us to other worlds. IE, we're the tool of her will, her bearers, carrying Her to other worlds.

SEP can provide significantly reduce the propellant mass required for mission, or more usefully allow more total deltaV so longer missions. This is well known and used to great effect on some missions which would not have been possible otherwise. The problem is SEP requires a very different mission trajectory design. So you kind of have to start with that in mind in the concept stages. But, NASA's use of risk and heritage metrics in mission selection makes it hard for newer technology like SEP to get on missions. No one wants to propose a mission that uses SEP if it carries with it a high risk metric since it may not get funded. So sometimes you have to force it if you want a new technology to become tested and used. But if it gets enough heritage, then it becomes a more attractive option risk wise. NTP will suffer the same problems the first few times people try to plan a mission with it, unless NASA ignores the risk. 

That said, SEP is kind of the standard these days for commerical satellites. There's like 300 SEP thrusters in orbit right now. So the technology is pretty mature, but just not in NASA's books for exploration missions. And honestly, even NTP is a pet project. There's lots of models that show it could work, but the practical questions of how do you store cryo hydrogen in space for 3 months, radiation shielding, cooling, structural stresses since NTP ships are really long, and other aspects are still open questions that need to be addressed before any NTP is ever launched.

I  don't fully understand your calculations and I'm just jumping into this  but I think I understand why the earth won't be burnt to a crisp.

I  don't see how your calculations take account of the energy density. If  Betelgeuse has indeed gone supernova it's gonna throw it's radiation in  all directions, so if you imagine a 600 light year radius sphere (which  is fun in its own right) the earth is only going to be exposed to a tiny  fraction of that, most of the energy is gonna miss us as it's spread  out across that entire giant sphere.

So it's not just the distance we are from the source , it's also the proportion of that energy we are actually exposed to.

I read in one article that we can each expect less radiation exposure from such an event than we would from eating a banana.""

It takes it fully into account.

The amount the Earth receives as **solar** energy from the sun **1379 W per square meter**

This equates to this formula:   ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (1.5 \* 10\^11 m)\^2) = 1379 W per square meter.

If you move Earth to say Mercury orbit around the sun. And assuming Mercury was furthest from the sun.

69 million km. =  6.9 × 10\^10 so the formula now is: ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (6.9 × 10\^10 m)\^2) = 6519 W/m\^2 =  6519 W per square meter.  6519/1379=4.73x

If Earth was at Mercury orbit at furthest point, it would receive 4.73x as much per square meter.

Similarly, if you move Earth further way, say to Neptune.  4.47 × 10\^12 - ((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (4.47\* 10\^12 m)\^2) = **1.553 W per square meter. Which correlates excatly to this:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight)

Table: [https://i.imgur.com/asmUVUi.png](https://i.imgur.com/asmUVUi.png)

You'll notice that the math fits exactly within the range. It applies further away or closer. And in a sphere. It drops exponentially, and goes up exponentially if you are closer. As neptune receives a measly 1.553 W per square meter.

Same factor for the supernova in year 1006. Its 7200 Light years, and thus is exponentially less vis-a-vis in comparison to betelgeuse of 600 light years.

((3.9 \* 10\^26 W)) / (4 π (1.49\* 10\^12 m)\^2)

Take a look between Saturn and Earth. Saturn is  1.4979 billion km from the sun, and earth is  147.29 million km. You can see about a 10x difference in distance.. But the solar radiation is  13.9 W per square meter.

So one is thinking, oh betelguese is only 10-12 times closer then the event in the year 1006. Okay, but Earth is only 10 times closer to the sun then Saturn. And the difference is rather massive.",,1580056556,{},ffmm5gw,True,t3_eu73ga,False,True,t3_eu73ga,/r/space/comments/eu73ga/betelgeuse_notes_and_the_possibility_of_a/ffmm5gw/,1580056803,1,True,False,space,t5_2qh87,0,,,
